ENTER MISS CICELY ADAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A GROUP of small boys stood on the corner,
looking anxiously down the shaded street.
They ranged from eight to twelve years in age;
from grimy hands to universal griminess in uncleanliness;
from comfortable meagreness to
ragged poverty in clothing, while in race they were
polyglot, but they were identical in the impatience
with which they scanned the sidewalk, vision-length,
and found it empty though there were frequent
passers-by.</p>

<p>“Gee! What’s the matter wid her?”</p>

<p>“Say! She wouldn’t go th’ udder way?”</p>

<p>“Th’ odder way nothin’! Don’t she know we’re
waitin’?”</p>

<p>The tallest, but also the raggedest, boy of the
group made a fine gesture, drawing a nickel watch
from somewhere between his bagging shirt and
tight trousers. “’Tain’t so late,” he said, displaying
the watch’s candid face. “Twenty to one by
mine, an’ I set her by the city hall when de ball
dropped’t noon. She ain’t so late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Whatjer bet she’s got, sour balls ’r peanuts?”
asked the smallest boy.</p>

<p>“Pennies, maybe!” hopefully suggested a young
Israelite not without guile; he was saving up for
an excursion.</p>

<p>“Git out! She don’t hand ’em out less’n she
didn’t have time to buy nothin’,” a boy scornfully
rebuked him. “Didn’ she tell us she hadn’t no
use fer money presen’s less’n she was up against
it fer time?”</p>

<p>“I bet she’s got somepin!” declared a round
little colored boy. “We’d ought t’ be gittin’ down
town; mos’ in gen’ly she’s here by now, an’ we’s
gotter git our af’ernoon ’ditions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, chase yourself, Coony! ’Tain’t near two.
Dere she is!”</p>

<p>The last speaker ended in a triumphant yell,
wildly pointing down the street as he jumped up
and down, his bare feet thudding on the pavement;
his comrades echoed the yell with Indian
War Dance gestures.</p>

<p>The cause of this suspense and final excitement
was a slender young figure, tall for a girl, but
looking taller than its actual height because of its
boyish lines, the straight short skirt and straight
loose jacket which clad it.</p>

<p>The girl wore light-weight summer tweed, several
colors blended in its weave to a tone of warm
brownish drab. Her gloveless hands were thrust
into the jacket’s side pockets; she wore a sailor
hat, pushed back somewhat from her brow, but
even if it had been set on her head straight, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
would not have confined her masses of brilliant
hair; they wreathed her face in lawless rings which
had the effect of a halo worn in jest.</p>

<p>She walked with a free, careless grace, a stride
that was businesslike, yet springing, as of one who
enjoyed the business which claimed her. Her face,
which was not pretty, yet was compounded of
many irregular charms, enhanced by a perfectly
regular beauty of skin, was bright with smiles as
she espied the shabby, yelling band awaiting her;
the smile displayed an unbroken row of strong
white teeth between full red lips. She waved her
hand at the lads with a gesture which was like
their own as they waved back at her, a straight-out
motion from the brim of her hat, then flung
widely out to the right.</p>

<p>“Gosh, ain’t her hair red!” cried one of the
boys, struck by the glow of the rings under the
sailor hat in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Red nothin’! You shut up!”</p>

<p>“Sure it’s red! What is it, then?” The question
in derision, not for information.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s hair.” The defender was at a loss,
not being accustomed to define.</p>

<p>“You bet! Red hair! Awful red hair!” The
triumphant tone was for victory, not because there
was any desire to disparage this newsboys’ goddess.</p>

<p>“Red hair yourse’f! Your mother’s red-headed!”
This was a shot in the dark; acquaintance between
these boys, being confined to the streets, did not
embrace knowledge of family tints.</p>

<p>“Sh’ ain’t! Black!” The wiry little Italian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
struck his opponent a hard blow on the mouth
with the back of his hand, and, with a growl like
two puppies, they clinched.</p>

<p>The approaching figure broke into a run and
came down upon them, the hair under dispute
glowing to the utmost justification of its accuser,
but the girl did not come like an avenging angel;
her smile had widened and her eyes laughed with
her lips, though it was a strong grasp that seized a
shoulder of each combatant and swung them apart.</p>

<p>“Here, you young heathens, what’s the matter
with you? Fend fighting!” she cried in a breezy,
clear young voice. “Tony Caprioli, slow down!
Mike McGinty, what’s wrong with you? Breaking
the law! Fend fighting, you know, you scalawags!”</p>

<p>“He said you’d got red hair. I said ’tain’t,”
muttered Tony, not yet “slowed down.”</p>

<p>“He hit me first. I didn’t mean nawthin’ but—it
looked red.” Mike delicately altered the
statement that he was about to make, implying that
the appearance of the hair was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The girl threw back her head and the brilliant
hair seemed to scintillate as she laughed a jolly
laugh.</p>

<p>“Tony, your name means goat—Caprioli—and
I’m afraid you’re it! Shame, my dear, when you’re
doing your best to bleach my hair, but Mike
scores! My hair is red, hot red, and what’s more
I’m not sorry it is! Shake, boys, and stop your
scrapping! Red hair is what gives me pep, and
pep is what makes me hustle around—when I’m
late, too!—and buy toffy squares for the crowd!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
So it’s all right, friend Tony, though I’m much
obliged to you for standing up for me! Catch,
fellows! I bought a box, two boxes, three squares
apiece, and good luck to you all! Hurry up! It’s
almost one o’clock, and I’ll have to run the rest
of the way, or the girl I relieve will fight <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>The animosity in the air cleared up like magic
under the spell of this girl’s merry laughter of
eyes and lips. She rapidly dealt out sticky squares
of toffy to the crowd, and boyishly, though daintily,
licked her finger tips when the last square had
left them.</p>

<p>“Enough of that!” she cried. “Suck it; don’t
chew it! You’ll get no more toffy till cool weather
comes! I was a dunce to buy anything so messy.
Balls, or peanuts, or anything neat for mine—and
so for yours!—till September! So long, boys,
dear; I’ve got to hustle. Hope you’ll each sell
more than any of the rest! Every last paper you
take out. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>She waved her hand to the adoring group; each
boy waved back again and shouted: “Good-bye!”
in spite of the difficulty of enunciation caused by
a large, soft toffy square in the roof of the mouth.</p>

<p>The girl hurried away, not running as she had
threatened to do, but walking so fast that running
would have been easier.</p>

<p>The group of boys melted around the corner,
in the direction of the shortest way to the newspaper
offices, and the funny little daily event was
over for the time being. The red-haired girl had
formed the acquaintance of this young mongrel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
band, and it had been her kindly whim to make
for them a daily small joy to anticipate. She
varied her gifts, but she never failed them; that
they adored her and exalted her into an incarnate
proof that human trustworthiness and kindness
was truth, not fiction, she was keen enough to see
was the best result of her action.</p>

<p>No one but herself and the boys knew about
“this freak philanthropy,” as she called it to herself;
it took but a few minutes of her time and
not a great expenditure of money. “It was worth
it,” so she told herself, “to let her red hair light
up the poor little snipes’ noon hour.”</p>

<p>The girl swung into a tall building at a tremendous
pace, her hands out of her pockets now, her
arms swinging to speed her action, not at all breathless,
but softly whistling: “Silver Threads among
the Gold,” a little twist around the corners of her
lips as she considered how distant that state of
things was from her own radiant locks.</p>

<p>She burst out of the elevator and into the great
room of the telephone exchange almost with one
movement, covering the intervening space between
one and the other door on a sort of slide.</p>

<p>“Well, Cis Adair! If I didn’t begin to wonder
if you’d get here!” cried a small, extremely-ornamented
young person waspishly, as the boyish red-haired
girl appeared, throwing off her hat and
jacket and hanging them up rapidly, smiling her
gay smile at the small person whom she succeeded.</p>

<p>“Sure—ly, Amelia! Don’t I always get there,
whether it’s to work or to play? I’m only five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
minutes late, anyway,” cried the newcomer, harnessing
her ears.</p>

<p>“Five minutes is five minutes when you’ve
got to get home, eat and dress. I’ve got a date,
I’d have you know, Miss Cicely!” retorted Amelia.</p>

<p>“Lucky you! Fruit market’s always closed for
me; can’t even get a date, not ever!” sighed Cicely
with a pensive droop of the head and an inimitable
little wink at the girl on her farther side.
“Sorry, Amelia! I’ll come five minutes early to-morrow,
so get another date ready. Might I hint
that you’d get there sooner if you started, now I
am here, than if you lingered to reproach me?”</p>

<p>The other girls laughed, and Amelia Day
flounced away with a toss of her head. It was
recognized in the office that there “was no sort of
use in trying to get ahead of Cis Adair.” Most
of the girls liked her, a few of them were her
devoted admirers, so it was only Amelia who ever
really longed to damage her happy-go-lucky confidence
in herself and in all her world.</p>

<p>“Funny little old Amelia!” Cis said after Amelia
had gone. “Seems to disagree with herself so like
fury, and not to be able to cut herself out of her
diet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cis!” murmured Nan Dowling, Cis’s next
neighbor, at whom she had winked. “You do say
such ridiculous things, and such just-right ones!
You ought to write. That’s Amelia all over; she
does disagree with herself—little sour ball!”</p>

<p>“Thought we agreed not to fuss about her,”
hinted Cis. “I don’t have to, as long as my shift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
follows hers; I don’t have more than a ships-that-pass-in-the-night,
<i>au revoir</i> intercourse with Miss
Day.”</p>

<p>“No, but I do! I have her from nine to one,
except during lunch, right in your place! Why
aren’t you on all through my shift, you blessed
old duck, Cis?” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“Never could answer whys, Nan; nothing
harder,” said Cis cheerfully. “Be glad you’ve
got the chance to sun yourself in the light of
my hair from one to six! And that we don’t get
a whole lot of calls on our wires, usually, till after
three, so we can ‘chin.’”</p>

<p>“Amelia is raving jealous of you, Cis, and you
know why!” said Nan. “She’d have your scalp,
if she could get it.”</p>

<p>“If she could get it she’d be welcome to it,”
declared Cis imperturbably. “Anyone that lets a
person get her hands on her scalp so she can lift
it, deserves to be scalped; that’s what I say! Amelia
can’t harm me as long as I do my work and tend
strictly to my own affairs. If you mean that
Amelia Day is still stewing because that puffy
Harold Brown thought he’d enjoy thinking that
he thought a lot of me—” Cis shrugged her shoulders
to conclude her sentence. “Stuff!” she added.</p>

<p>Nan laughed, but she looked anxious. “All the
same, Amelia would love to get you out, Cis,” she
said. “Of course you don’t care a rap what Harold
Brown does—”</p>

<p>“Care!” Cis interrupted her. “Ever see a chestnut
worm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Both girls went off into a spasm of laughter,
subdued, not to disturb their companions. Harold
Brown was large, plump, puffy and abnormally
white; nothing was needed to point Cis’s rhetorical
question.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cis!” sighed Nan, as she sighed many times
a day, in fervent, admiring delight over Cicely’s
high spirits. “Such a Cis!”</p>

<p>Nan had a call just then, but when she had
answered it and was free again, she turned to Cis.</p>

<p>“It’s not only Harold Brown, Cis; you don’t
seem to care about any of them,” she said.</p>

<p>“Meaning boys and men?” asked Cis. “Wrong
you are, my Nanny: I love ’em all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, like one of themselves!” retorted Nan.
“But not the way they do you! You’re like a
jolly boy yourself, friendly as anything, but you
don’t—And there are lots of them crazy about
you! You make them sort of crazy over you, Cis,
with your come-on-stand-off way, and your sort of—heady
charm, like champagne!”</p>

<p>“Oh, say!” protested Cis. “Much you know
about champagne, kid dear! You got that out of
a novel; own up! The price of it per bottle, and
the Eighteenth sitting on the bottles, shows that’s
a pure flight of fancy! Stick to facts, Anna
Dowling! Me heady! I should say not!”</p>

<p>With that Cicely had a call, followed by five
other calls, which kept her busy plugging in and
attending to the time for awhile. When this was
over, a lull followed, and Cis turned again to Nan.</p>

<p>“That was a coincidence, a sort of coincidental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
run,” she said, “The first call was Parkway 58—and
we know what that is, don’t we, Nanny?”</p>

<p>“Of course; Miss Lucas,” said Nan promptly.</p>

<p>“Neither of us ever thinks of any other Lucas
but Miss Jeanette Lucas; we always forget
there are other Lucases, a father, a mother, a
younger sister, and a few boys, too young to
matter, scattering along,” commented Cis. “But
it was for Miss Lucas, and what is more, it was
her betrothed calling her. I always know his voice.
To be truthful, I don’t half like it; it’s sweet,
cloying, yet it isn’t sweet—sounds the way maple
syrup tastes when it’s just beginning to work. At
our house maple syrup always seems to work before
it gets eaten; I don’t know how often Miss
Spencer puts it on the table like that! It’s an
awful sell when you pour it over cakes! Well,
about Mr. Herbert Dale’s voice. I’m nuts on
voices; I think they give their owners away more
than anything else, and I don’t like that voice over
the ’phone. Hope I’m wrong, because Miss
Jeanette Lucas is a fine girl. I met her once,
though she wouldn’t remember it, probably. She’s
a gentle, sweet, ladylike, old-fashioned sort of girl,
and I imagine she’s the kind that loves a man
adoringly, when she gets about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to love the man one marries,”
declared romantic Nan.</p>

<p>“No disputing the proposition, but it’s dangerous,
because most men are quite a good deal
human,” Cis observed dryly.</p>

<p>“You needn’t talk! If you ever fall in love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
you’ll pave the path of the man with your whole
self!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“Heavens! Not so loud, Nan! That’s nothing
to tell a crowd! Besides I would not!” whispered
Cicely.</p>

<p>Then with a swift abandonment of her position,
she said aloud, with a suppressed vehemence:
“Well, what would be the fun of loving any other
way?”</p>

<p>“Not much fun, either, when you take it like
a fatal disease,” said Nan. “Where was the coincidence
in Mr. Dale’s calling up Miss Lucas, Cis?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere. But the coincidence was that the
rest of those calls I had were Miss Lucas calling
up Oldboy’s store, and a dressmaker, and a jeweller,
and a garage,” Cis explained.</p>

<p>“She would, she does every day. Of course she
would, now that she is getting ready to be married
as fast as she can,” murmured Nan, disappointed
that there was no more in Cicely’s mystery.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” agreed Cis. “I merely said
that she called these people as soon as her betrothed
rang off. Ever notice the way he calls?
I’d not only know his voice over a wire in China,
but he gives the number so peculiarly: ‘I’d like to
get 58, the Parkway, if you please.’” Cis imitated
an oily, smooth voice, unctuously used, and Nan
laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s he!” she cried. “You’re a mocking bird
as well as a tanager, as you call yourself, Cis!
The paper last Sunday had Miss Lucas’ picture on
the society page, with Mr. Herbert Dale’s, and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
they’d be married on the 10th of next month, in
our church, with a Nuptial Mass. Is Mr. Dale a
Catholic, Cis?”</p>

<p>“Not enough to notice, I think,” said Cis. “His
people are. The Lucases are strict; I suspect that
sweet Jeanette will make him toe the mark when
it comes to the wedding. Probably she’s got a
candle burning all the time before the Lourdes
shrine, and means to make him a saint at the end
of six months. Wish she may! I’m sure I don’t
really know but he’s going that way on his own,
but I honestly hate his voice!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you queer, Cis? You don’t often get
down on anyone; you’re pretty sure to give everyone
the benefit of the doubt,” cried Nan, wondering.
Then she hesitated, and whispered: “Did you
go to the seven o’clock yesterday, Cis, dear?”</p>

<p>Cis shook her head, her color mounting slightly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see you at the eight o’clock Mass, as
usual,” persisted Nan timidly, for Cicely looked
forbidding.</p>

<p>“Good reason why,” said Cis shortly. “I wasn’t
there. And I didn’t go to Late Mass, so don’t go
on to that, Nan; I didn’t go at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cicely dear!” Pain crept into Nan’s words,
though they were whispered.</p>

<p>“Well! Oh, Nan dear!” Cis tried to laugh at
her. “Yes, I know I’m bad, but I was so tired!
I was out till after one, danced, and ate such a
supper! I did mean to go to the eight, but I turned
over, stretched and—” Cis made a slight gesture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
that conveyed the suggestion of a passage beyond
daily affairs.</p>

<p>“Cis, oh, Cis! And you are so fine, so splendid!
Why don’t you make it perfect? You’re a
Catholic,” sighed loving Nan, her gentle eyes
clouded.</p>

<p>“I’m nothing else, at least, Nanny, but it doesn’t
bother me a great deal, all this that has to do with
such far-off things! I’m sorry, nice little Nan! I
will brace up, I promise you, and go to Mass Sundays.
When I get there, it’s hot and crowded, and
I’m just there in my body, and not my mind,
and it’s a mighty uncomfortable body, I can
tell you that! I wonder if it makes much
difference whether you go or not, when you go
like an oyster? Sorry, Nanny,” Cis said again,
seeing how grieved Nan looked. “I didn’t have
your training; maybe that’s it. I went to public
school and high school, and my mother died when
I was eight, and my father was no good, and went
off to his own ways when I was a baby, so I’m
kind of a hybrid Catholic-heathen! Sorry, nice
little Nan!”</p>

<p>“You’re the biggest girl I know, the truest and
finest, and I’m sure God will pull you to Him.
You’re too great to miss the Greatest,” said Nan,
with such earnestness in spite of her muffled voice,
and with such a light in her eyes, that careless
Cicely was impressed.</p>

<p>“Put your candle beside Miss Jeanette Lucas’,”
she said, knowing that the look in Nan’s eyes foretold
prayers for her beloved Cicely’s safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“You two girls have talked enough in duet for
one day,” remonstrated another girl, a little distance
down the table from Cis and Nan. “We like a
whack at Cis ourselves, Nan Dowling!”</p>

<p>“Won’t get much more chance to talk, duet or
chorus,” said Cis. “Half past two, and the afternoon
buzz is beginning.”</p>

<p>It was a particularly busy afternoon in this uptown
exchange. Nan went off duty at five, but she
waited that night to go out to supper with Cis,
whose hours did not end till ten at night, and who
supped in the restaurant on the top floor of the
building, and returned to the exchange to finish
her eight-hours’ shift.</p>

<p>Cis did not know what fear was; she went about
the quiet streets after ten o’clock at night, when she
was returning to her boarding place, with the same
careless assurance with which she walked the
streets at ten o’clock in the morning. There was
that about her carriage, her free, graceful walk, her
faultless complexion, her glowing, abundant, striking
hair that made her a conspicuous figure; yet
there was also in her entire effect that indifference
to notice, that light-hearted frankness, that absence
of self-consciousness, which reveals the Una-like
girl who walks the earth fearing no man because
she seeks no man’s admiration.</p>

<p>It is the glory of our American curious compound,
that such a maidenly girl is rarely molested
if she keeps within decent neighborhoods at not
too-late hours, and Cicely Adair went and came as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
safely as if she were a child playing in her father’s
garden.</p>

<p>“I hate to leave you, Cis, but nothing ever does
happen to you,” said Nan, after they had supped,
and Cicely was preparing to return to the office and
Nan to go home.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be a mighty protection, small
Nan,” laughed Cis. “Nonsense, child! I’m off by
ten, and that’s only an hour after nine, and nine
is curfew hour, so that’s all right! I’ll go back to
the office and join up the rest of the world on wires,
and go home as I always do. Don’t you know, no
one would dare molest a red-haired girl? I fly a
danger signal on top, and they turn out for me!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

THE RÔLE OF PERSEUS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CIS resumed her place at the long table, and
slipped what she called “her bridle” around
her head with the cheerful philosophy customary
to her at this end of her eight-hours’ employment.
She had somewhere in the back of her brain a suppressed
consciousness that there were pleasanter
ways for attractive and lively youth to spend an
evening, but this was “her job.” “My job”
summed up in Cis’s mind and on her tongue a
whole unformulated, yet distinct code of duty.
What was one’s job must be done, that was clear
enough, and done well, no shirking, still more, no
neglect. If one took a job, fidelity was implied
in its acceptance: “Take it or leave it, but if you
take it, take it down to the ground,” Cis would
have put it. She despised a shirker and a slacker;
she “played the game straight,” whatever game she
entered upon. “Her job” stood for the flag in a
soldier’s hand, the pledge of an obligation. “If
you take a man’s money deliver the goods,” Cis
told another girl who was not serving well her
employer’s interests. It was not a bad code to steer
by, as far as it went; if it did not imply supernatural
motives, it was a good foundation upon
which to build them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>The girl who had taken Nan’s place while Cis
was out, was by no means Nan; she was an unattractive
person to Cicely. Indeed, there was no
other girl in the room for whom friendly Cis, who
felt kindly disposed to them all, ready to oblige
and amuse them, cared in the least. Cicely, who
had been graduated from high school, and Nan,
the devout little product of the parochial school,
were better educated than any of their companions.
Neither Cis nor Nan had time, nor desire for much
reading; they were far from being cultivated girls,
but they were well taught, and they found little
to attract them in the foolish interests, badly expressed,
the tiresome conversation of their working
mates.</p>

<p>So when Cis resumed her place, she nodded in
return to the nod from the bobbed hair now beside
her; said a few words which set the girl to whom
they were spoken, off into a giggle, and turned her
attention to her switchboard, as a hint that business
only was her end in view.</p>

<p>In this uptown exchange early evening calls were
many; there would not have been the opportunity
for talk, had Cis desired it, which she and Nan
usually found in the afternoon. Cis plugged-in
rapidly; answered questions—rather more than
was her office—corrected errors, untangled the
difficulties of the old gentleman who turned in
many calls every night and regularly called wrong
numbers, till nine o’clock was recorded on the wall
clock regulated by telegraph from Washington, and
Cicely Adair drew a long breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“One more hour!” she said aloud. “Went fast
to-night!”</p>

<p>“Someone meetin’ you, Cis?” asked her neighbor.</p>

<p>Cicely shook her head. “I’m the cat that walks
by herself,” she said lightly. “Not a man will
bother with me—but, as to that, none will bother
me going home, so it works good and bad!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so!” her neighbor derisively replied.
“Pity ’bout you! Us girls are on to you,
Miss Adair! The fellers’d tumble for you if you
didn’t jack ’em up!”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks! But I won’t have anyone calling
for me; puts you under obligations,” said Cis impatiently.</p>

<p>“You said a mouthful!” the girl endorsed her,
then added significantly: “I got one comin’ after
me, but I don’t get off till one, Q. T. Dang’rous
goin’ alone at that littlest hour!”</p>

<p>The girl laughed and Cis looked disgusted, drawing
away with a slight, involuntary movement before
she recalled herself. Then she said:</p>

<p>“One is a lot later than ten, more than the four
hours later. Glad you’ve someone to see you safe,
Mimi.”</p>

<p>Cicely turned back to her switchboard, refusing
to share the humor of Mimi’s being escorted home,
and as she did so she received a call.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get 12, the Boulevard, if you please,”
a voice said.</p>

<p>Cicely said sharply: “<i>What</i> number did you
say?”</p>

<p>She recognized the voice and the peculiar form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
of its call. It was the oily, yet sub-acid voice
which Cis had said was like maple syrup beginning
to ferment, the voice which she distrusted, the
voice of sweet Jeanette Lucas’ betrothed, to whom
her marriage was imminent.</p>

<p>“What number did you say?” Cicely therefore
said sharply; could he have possibly mistaken his
call? Parkway 58 was the Lucas call, and this,
Boulevard 12—Why, in the name of all that was
good and loyal was this Herbert Dale calling Boulevard
12?</p>

<p>“I’d like to get 12, the Boulevard,” repeated the
suave voice, this time with its sub-acid quality less
submerged.</p>

<p>Cicely plugged-in for the required number, but
her wits were working quickly, her warm heart was
beating fast, sending the blood up to her bright
hair with a generous, pitying indignation for the
girl whom she admired at a distance, whom she had
set up in a sort of shrine as the ideal maiden.</p>

<p>Cicely was not in the habit of indulging curiosity
by “listening in”; indeed, she felt little curiosity
as to other people’s affairs, but now what she
felt was not curiosity, but a burning sympathy for
that other girl. Therefore she listened in. Only
a few moments did she listen to the conversation
between Herbert Dale, on one end of the wire, and
someone at Boulevard 12 on the other. She heard
enough to satisfy her that her favorite theory of
voices being indicative had a solid foundation in
fact. She jerked herself away from her eavesdropping,
let her hands fall into her lap, nervously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
twisting her fingers, her head bowed as she rapidly
examined herself as to what she meant to do about
it.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete, Cis Adair, your face’s
redder’n your hair; you’re <i>all</i> red! You listened
in! What’s up?” cried her neighbor, putting out
her hand to follow Cicely’s example.</p>

<p>“Keep off! It’s my business!” ordered Cicely
sharply, and the girl thought it better to abandon
her plan, warned by the flash in Cis’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Just hold your tongue, Mimi, a bit; I’ve got to
think,” Cis added, and again Mimi obeyed her.</p>

<p>“She won’t thank me,” Cis told herself. “Not
now, anyway; may later. But it’s not a square deal
to keep her in the dark. If she chooses to go on
with him, it’s her business, but she ought to have
the chance to choose; that’s it! She’s no sort of
idea. She’s a little idiot if she marries him, knowing
he can’t be trusted when such a girl’s that has
set the 10th for the wedding. But that’s her affair.
I’ll not deal straight with her if I don’t let her in
on what I know. It’ll hit her hard, poor kid, but
it might be worse, only she won’t see that now.
It will cost me my job. Mimi’s sure to tell Amelia;
she’s thick with her. I’ll be giving her my scalp,
sure and certain. Well, what of it? What’s my
job, beside the whole life of a mighty fine girl?
Mimi may hold her tongue—No, she won’t! Well,
if it makes me pay, what’s that to do with the rights
of it? I’d take it pretty cruel if another girl didn’t
stand by me in Miss Lucas’ place. I’m going to do
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Cicely set her plug in Parkway 58; her hand
trembled as she did so. Mimi, watching intently,
saw it shake. She was suspicious. To let anyone
in on a wire to listen to a conversation was to break
one of the fundamental laws of the company.</p>

<p>Mimi suspected that Cicely Adair was breaking
that law now.</p>

<p>“Is this Miss Lucas? Miss Jeanette Lucas?” Cis
asked. “Please hold your receiver. I’m connecting
you on a wire. It’s something you must hear.
Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Then Cis dropped her face into her hands and
sat quite still, as if she were waiting for the stroke
of fate. No stroke fell, however; the call for
Boulevard 12 was rung off; Cis noted the excess
rate, which was considerable, and notified the public
station whence the call had come, of the amount
due. She half expected to be called by Jeanette
Lucas, impersonally, as “Central,” but no such
call came, and when the office clock pointed to ten,
Cicely arose, doffed her “bridle,” and turned to
Mimi.</p>

<p>“See here, Mimi,” she said, “I never did think
there was much use in asking a girl for a solemn
promise to keep a secret. If you tell her you don’t
want something told she won’t tell it, if she’s white;
if she’s any other color all the promises this side
of Jericho won’t stop her talking. Now, of course
you know I did something to-night that’s dead
against the rules, but I tell you that it was the only
decent thing to do, and whatever happened I knew
I had to do it, and I’d do it again this minute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
because it <i>was</i> right. I’ve had time to think it
over, and I’m surer every instant that I did the
square thing. That’s all I can tell you, or anyone,
because the rest is none of our business. I
don’t want you to tell a living soul what you saw
and heard; I ask you not to. And that’s all I
can do about it. If you keep your tongue between
your teeth I’ll not forget it of you, and I’ll do
you a good turn the first chance I get. Signed:
Cicely Adair.”</p>

<p>Mimi laughed. “Sent special? All right; I got
it. Say, Cis, Amelia ’n me ’s pals, but I’m not
with her ’bout you. She’s jealous, that’s what’s
eatin’ ’Melia. I ain’t; I don’t haf to be! I won’t
tell. It’s a rich one, but I won’t tell; honest, cross
m’ heart! The comp’ny wouldn’t do a thing to
you if they heard it, I’ll tell the world! Don’t you
worry, Cis; I like you; you’re a great one. I’ll
never give you away, don’t you fret! Gee! What
d’you s’pose ’Melia’d do to you if she had you
down like this! She says you think you’re the cat’s
miauw. She’d give you a miauw, I’ll say she
would!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mimi. It’s straight of you to keep this
to yourself. Good night,” said Cis, and went away.
“Little snipe! Sure she’ll tell Amelia!” she
thought as she walked rapidly down the quiet
street.</p>

<p>The next day passed without anything unusual
to mark it, to Cicely’s surprise. She felt that anything
and everything were imminent, but nothing
more exciting befell her than being one bag of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
peanuts short in her noon distribution to her gamin
friends, owing to the unforeseen appearance of
Tony Caprioli’s little brother, who had to be compensated
with a nickel. It was a perfectly satisfactory
substitute, Cis found to her relief, mainly
because Tony divided his peanuts with the young
Luigi, who thus came out well ahead of the game.</p>

<p>The second day, however, Cicely’s bright head
fell under the guillotine, a martyr to a certain kind
of nobility which makes the figure of the guillotine
not unsuitable.</p>

<p>When Cis came into the office, nearly ten minutes
ahead of her schedule, there fell upon all the
girls that significant hush which eloquently declares
by its silence that the newcomer has been
the subject of conversation up to the moment when
the door swung. Amelia’s face was red beyond
and additionally to the paint which frankly
adorned her cheeks and lips; she looked malevolent
and triumphant. Nan was flushed, almost
purpling; her eyes were nervously excited and tearful.
All the other girls looked uncomfortable, and
most of them looked regretful, Cis was glad to see,
for she instantly knew what had happened.</p>

<p>“I’m workin’ double shift, Cis; no need you
settin’ down. I’m doin’ your shift till the next
orders. You’re to go to th’ office soon’s you show
up,” said Amelia gloatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, they were slow about it!” exclaimed Cis
swinging around. “I thought I’d hear this yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cis, Cis, dear!” moaned Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Nobody’s to blame but yourself, Cis Adair!
Mimi didn’t want to tell on you, but when she
tol’ me, I said she’d ought to come out with it, not
let nice girls that kep’ the rules get looked at
crooked for what <i>they</i> wouldn’t do, not for nothin’.
What I say is, it’s easy rule to keep; simply tend
to your own bus’nuss. Listenin’ in ain’t what
int’rusts <i>me</i>; it don’t girls that’s got gentlemen
friends an’ ev’rything. I’ll do your work to-day,
Cis Adair, but the comp’ny won’t let <i>me</i> overdo
long, I’ll tell the world! You’re wanted in the
office, Cis Adair, an’ it’s a cinch you’re not wanted
elsewheres!” Amelia delivered her speech explosively.</p>

<p>Cis laughed lightly as she went toward the door.</p>

<p>“Do you honestly think that I didn’t know precisely
what would happen when I—when I—danced,
would you call it? I knew what the fiddler
would cost,” she said. “Don’t weep for me,
Amelia! Nancy, stay down and have supper with
me, will you? I’ll be waiting for you in the drug
store.”</p>

<p>Nan nodded, speechless, and Cis went off, without
outward sign of perturbation, to meet the manager
of this office, who had always been her friend,
as he had proved in many trifling ways.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Adair, I’m sorry to have to see you
to-day, and for the reason which made me summon
you. Please be seated,” he said. “I think you
must know that reason?”</p>

<p>“Not much use in play-acting, Mr. Singer, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
I’m not going to pretend I don’t! Yes, I know,”
said Cis.</p>

<p>“One of our subscribers reported to us yesterday
that a girl in our exchange had connected another
of our subscribers with a conversation which he
was holding. This action has, justly, too, infuriated
the gentleman whose conversation was thus
overheard. He has demanded that we find and
properly punish the offending operator. Her
action has led to the most disastrous consequences,
in fact to great loss and grief to the gentleman—”</p>

<p>“No! Has it, though?” cried Cis almost springing
to her feet. “Then she was game; she did
have sense enough to throw him down!”</p>

<p>“Evidently, Miss Adair, your action was intended
to work harm to the gentleman. Do you
know him personally, or the subscriber whom you
connected with his wire?”</p>

<p>Mr. Singer, Cis felt sure, was controlling a desire
to laugh.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, but when a nice girl is getting
fooled—”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Adair, that will do. Let us avoid
open allusions. Knowing you, I am inclined to
think that you acted from a sort of mistaken
chivalry; that you yielded to an impulse to save
another girl from what you feared would be greater
sorrow than you were inflicting upon her. You
see, I give you full credit for good, even for rather
fine motives, and I acknowledge that it is refreshing
to find a girl with ideals such as this reveals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
But it won’t do, Miss Adair, it won’t do! The
telephone company is not in business to guard
morals, nor its subscribers’ welfare; it is in business
to transmit messages and to see that their
privacy is secured to their subscribers. You have
broken one of the fundamental, inviolable rules of
your office, and there is nothing for me to do but
dismiss you.” Mr. Singer ended with regret in
his voice.</p>

<p>“Sure, Mr. Singer!” Cis agreed. “I knew it
would come out, and I’d be thrown down. Sorry,
but I’d do it right over again this minute.”</p>

<p>“I quite believe that!” Mr. Singer allowed himself
a sound of laughter in his throat that did not
pass his lips. “You have been a good operator,
Miss Adair; quick, yet patient; faithful, punctual,
and—until now—highly honorable. I’m exceedingly
sorry to lose you, sorrier to dismiss you. I
wish that you had not felt it necessary to load your
gun and take a shot at birds, which were, after
all, not in your field.”</p>

<p>“If you had a daughter, or a sister, a nice, a
lovely girl, all innocent and—and well, <i>white</i>, Mr.
Singer, wouldn’t you give her a chance to keep out
of a regular sell, wouldn’t you put her wise and
let her have her chance, at least? I bet you would,
and I did!” cried Cicely.</p>

<p>Mr. Singer arose, holding out his hand in farewell,
not otherwise replying to Cicely’s question.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Miss Adair, and good luck. If I can
be of use to you, let me know. But in your next
position keep to your rules, and don’t let your imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
lead you into quixotic scrapes,” he said.
“The cashier will give you your check. I’ll gladly
recommend you to anyone whom you may send to
me, but I cannot condone your disobedience here.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” Cis heartily agreed. “Thanks,
Mr. Singer. I knew I’d lose my head, so don’t
feel sorry about it. You know red heads get
through worse thickets than this one. You’ve been
downright dandy to me; much obliged, honest!
Good-bye; sorry to say it to you, but I’m glad about
the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“We had a little difficulty in identifying the
offender, but at last we did so, through one of the
girls whose friend had been a witness to your imprudence,”
said Mr. Singer, politely holding the
door open for his unrepentant employee to leave
him.</p>

<p>“There weren’t many between whom to choose;
all you had to do was to ask me; I’m on till ten
on that section. I’d have told you I did it, if you’d
asked me,” said Cis, halting in the doorway.</p>

<p>“You certainly would have, Cicely the Sincere!”
cried Mr. Singer, and this time he laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Nan hurried from the exchange at five o’clock
sharp, and around to the drug store where Cicely
was awaiting her.</p>

<p>“We don’t eat to-night in the Tel. Restaurant,
Nancy Bell; we eat at Hildreth’s, one of his regular
old ripping platter suppers: lobster; little necks
sitting around him; broiled finan haddy, relishes—who
minds being a Catholic on Friday when
she’s got the price of Hildreth’s about her?” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Cis, seizing Nan’s hand and tucking it into her
arm. “Drew my last check from the Tel. Co., so
it’s on me, and a treat at Hildreth’s, just to celebrate!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cis, Cis, what are you going to do next?”
sighed Nan, yielding, yet disapproving this extravagance.</p>

<p>“After the supper? I hadn’t thought. Movie?
But we don’t care for movies!” Cis pretended
to meditate.</p>

<p>“You know I don’t mean that! What sort of
work will you try for? Where will you go—”</p>

<p>Cis interrupted her by whistling blithely, as well
as any boy could whistle, as indifferent as a boy
to passers-by: “Oh, boys, where do we go from
here?”</p>

<p>“Wait till after lobster, Nan, and I’ll tell you,”
Cis then said, seeing Nan’s real distress.</p>

<p>“Oh, that means something that would spoil my
appetite!” cried prophetic Nan.</p>

<p>After a delicious supper in the famous sea-food
specialty restaurant, to which Cis did fuller justice
than Nan, Cis lay back in her chair, her small cup
of black coffee before her, her eyes on the contorted
shoulders of the ’cellist of the orchestra of
four pieces which “helped float the fish,” Cis said.</p>

<p>“Going to tell me?” hinted Nan.</p>

<p>“I hate to, Nan, because I know you’ll hate it,
and so do I, when I think of you. But I’m going
to get out of here, altogether; I’m going to Beaconhite
to try my luck,” announced Cicely.</p>

<p>“Beaconhite! Whatever <i>for</i>?” gasped Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Never could tell you,” said Cis airily. “Always
wanted to try that little city. Spells its name so
crazy, that’s one reason; must have been Beacon
Height once, of course. I always had an idea I’d
like it; it’s hustling, yet settled. I’ve some money
saved up; not much; enough to carry me on till
I get to earning, and I’m dead sick, dead tired of
here! Not tired of you, little Nan, but of the
place. I think I’d better move up a square or
two; ’tisn’t good to cork up too much fermentation.
Honest, Nan, it’s lucky I’ve not taken up
that vitamine bug they’re all rushing so! If I ate
yeast cakes, like the rest of ’em, I’d fly to pieces!
I’m going to Beaconhite and show it what a red-haired
girl can do to it! Nanny, don’t look so
sorry! And don’t cry, dear! That lobster shell
had enough salt water, and too much hot water!”</p>

<p>“You’ll forget all about me, and I love you
dearly, Cis,” faltered Nan.</p>

<p>“I’m just as fond of you as you are of me, nice
little Silly!” cried Cis. “Only I’m not keen on
mushiness. You’ve got to allow me one virtue: I
stick when once I’m stuck; no waving around to
this solid body! We’ll be just as good friends, and
we’ll get together again, here or there, but it’s the
truth, Nan; I’ve got to break off, and break out
new, or my red hair’ll blaze up like a fire balloon,
and there’ll be no more of Miss Adair! I hated
to tell you, but I’m glad it’s done! If this hadn’t
happened in the office I’d have left next October;
now it has happened, I’m going right off—or
sooner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Right off? How soon, Cis?” faltered Nan.</p>

<p>“This is Friday; don’t you think Monday is a
good day to start a new record? First day of the
week, first <i>week</i> day of the week, and washing
day?” Cis suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose any other day would be easier,”
admitted Nan. “Will you stay with me Sunday
night, start from my house? Oh, Cis, Cis! There
are only two days before Monday, and I never
dreamed, never once <i>dreamed</i> this morning that
I’d ever lose you!”</p>

<p>“I’m not dreaming it now, Nanny dear. We’re
friends for keeps. You can’t lose me; I’m not that
sort. Come along, Nan. I’m fed up on lobster,
and I’m much more fed up on those fiddlers three—like
Old King Cole’s. But I seem to miss a
jolly old soul in this crowd of two!”</p>

<p>Cis jumped up, paid the reckoning, and tucked
Nan under her arm after her usual custom, her
height and Nan’s being adapted to this arrangement.</p>

<p>Thus they left the restaurant, Cis humming an
old song which she had picked up from one of
her elders: “You can’t lose me, mah Honey,” as
appropriate to her assurance, to Nan, and as if she
had not a care in the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

MISS JEANETTE LUCAS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CIS spent Saturday forenoon picking up her belongings,
packing certain things in a large old
trunk, others of more immediate emphasis in a
perfectly new, smaller trunk, leaving pictures and
the few pieces of bric-a-brac which she owned, to
be boxed.</p>

<p>She was entirely cheerful over these preparations,
whistling softly between closed teeth, sometimes
breaking into a snatch of song; it was evident
that change was by no means unwelcome to her.</p>

<p>Nan Dowling, on the contrary, sat on the edge
of the bed, avoiding physical comfort as her body
dropped from extreme mental discomfort, watching
Cis with her hands clasped, hanging forward
between her knees; her lips drawn down, her eyes
gloomy. She had the forenoon free because she
was going on duty at one, Cis’s old time, having
made an exchange with another girl who gladly
accepted the chance to have an evening off, especially
Saturday evening.</p>

<p>“Cis, don’t take everything you own with you!”
remonstrated Nan. “Pack a trunk to leave at my
house.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why?” said Cis absent-mindedly.
“Believe I’ll give this blouse to the waitress. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
a bit tight for me, though it’s still as good as ever,
but that poor little lean thing will like something
decent, and she’ll be able to lap it over the way
it was meant to go; I can’t.”</p>

<p>She held up a pretty linen shirt-waist, turning
it by the shoulders, considering it in the sunshine’s
strong light.</p>

<p>“You wonder why you should leave a trunk with
me?” Nan persisted, ignoring Cis’s suggestion of
the gift. “Because it looks so horridly final when
you’ve taken everything with you; you may want
to come home again. At least you might let me
hope that you will, let me feel I had a link with
you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t come back next winter, Nanny; I’ll
push on farther if Beaconhite doesn’t appreciate
me—or I appreciate it. I don’t say I’ll never come
back, but I know I’m going to keep away a while,”
declared Cis. “So there’s no telling what I could
get on without. And as to that word ‘home’ you
used, where’s my home? In those trunks! A girl
like me, without kith nor kin, boarding or lodging,
hasn’t a home. Of course, I’ll always call this old
town home, because I was born here and grew up
here, but that’s nonsense, when you come to think
of it. You’re the only thing here to come back
to; I don’t need to leave a trunk to hitch me up
to you, small Person! So your silly Cicely takes
all she owns with her. Say, Nan, why do you
suppose they didn’t nickname me Silly, instead of
Cis? Comes just as straight from Cicely!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Cis! You always make me feel as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
you were a kite and the rope was slipping through
my fingers! You’re the friendliest thing, yet you
don’t care one bit for people—unless it is for me?”
sighed Nan. “Aren’t you going to say good-bye to
Father Lennon? And—and—go to confession this
afternoon before you start?”</p>

<p>Cis shook her head hard. “Not time for confession
for me yet; not for quite a long while. I’ll
turn up somewhere by Easter, maybe at Christmas!
Don’t look bothered, good little Nan! I’m going
to be honest whatever else I am. I often wonder
if I’m honest to go at all. You don’t think God
can like us to pretend, do you?” Cis turned unexpectedly
serious.</p>

<p>“I think He likes us to hold on hard when we
are tempted to let go, and that we can be honest
in wanting to hold on, at least,” said Nan slowly.
“I’m pretty sure this idea you have of being honest
is dangerous. Isn’t it just as honest to receive the
sacraments because you know you ought to, as because
you happen to feel like it? And there’s more
merit in it, so it is sure to earn the feeling for you
after a while?”</p>

<p>Nan spoke hesitatingly; she stood in awe of Cis,
of her cleverness, her reserves, and also her unreserve,
which was likely at any time to shock Nan.</p>

<p>“Maybe, nice Nanny,” Cis assented lightly. “I’m
so full of pep that I don’t crave anything that life
can’t give, and I don’t think I’m a great sinner,
honest! I’m pretty square; I tell the truth; I hate
lowness; I don’t harm people, I even like to oil
other people’s springs when the going’s hard. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
don’t know exactly what religion does mean to me;
I’ve got some, at least I’d never be anything but
Catholic, but I can’t see why I’m not living a decent
life, better than some people’s who are at confession
every couple of weeks or so.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Cis, and you’re a peach; you know
what I think of you, part of it, anyway. But that’s
not all of it. I’m no good at explaining, but all
that’s just this world,” Nan faltered; she could
have made her meaning clearer, but she shrank
from preaching to Cis.</p>

<p>“This world it is, Nancy Bell! Where else is
our address? I’ve heard about it; you mean what
they say in church about ‘natural virtues.’ Well,
I’d like to know who created nature, what’s wrong
with natural virtue? It’s a nice, natural thing to
be jolly, and kindly, and not jealous, or hen-minded—hen-minded
and snake-acting! And
you’ve got to own up that some pious people are
just as jealous and harsh as can be, wouldn’t deal
half as decently with other folks as Cis, the Sinner!
So that same Cis can’t feel she’s so awfully a
sinner! As to saying good-bye to Father Lennon,
why on earth should I bother him and myself,
now I’m going away, when I never saw him to
talk to him when I was here?” Cis flicked a
scarf into Nan’s face, adding:</p>

<p>“Smile awhile, Nancy! I may be headed wrong,
but I’m not dying, and perhaps I’ll brace up and
turn saintly before Father Lennon—or someone
else—comes to say good-bye to me for good and
all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“You’re so big and brave and daring; you’re
like a soldier! I can’t bear to have you miss connections,
Cis.” Nan said softly. “Not enlist.”</p>

<p>“Nice Nanny!” Cis began again, then held up
her hand.</p>

<p>“Footsteps on the stairs, strange ones! Nan,
they’re coming this way! Think the company is
sorry, and is sending me an appointment in the
main office?”</p>

<p>Cis opened her door to a boy who knocked, a
messenger boy.</p>

<p>“Miss Cicely Adair,” said the boy, glancing from
one to the other girl. “Answer. I wait—R. S.
V. P., see?”</p>

<p>“I see!” cried Cis, smiling at the boy in perfect
sympathy with his boyhood.</p>

<p>“I’m the lady you seek! Sit down—but for
goodness’ sake don’t sit on my best hat! I’ll read,
then I’ll write—maybe!”</p>

<p>She tore open the envelope addressed to her in
an unknown, feminine hand, an unusual hand, full
of character and refinement; she drew forth its
contents.</p>

<p>“Well, Nan!” exclaimed Cis. “It’s from Miss
Lucas! Here, read it!”</p>

<p>Then she threw on the floor a pile of articles
which covered a straight chair’s seat, shoved back
other things from the table end, and wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Lucas</span>:—I’ll be at your house
between three and four, as you ask.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours sincerely,</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Cicely Adair</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>She addressed an envelope, folded her tiny note,
sealed it in the envelope, and handed it to the boy,
who rose to go.</p>

<p>“You’re one!” he said admiringly. “That’s the
kind o’ letter! Don’t have to hurt your eyes over
it! Mostly they writes tons. Had the deuce of
a time findin’ you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you one bit!” said Cis cordially.
“I have an awful time finding myself! But I
think it pays in the end.”</p>

<p>“Yeh,” the boy grinned, instantly, like all boys,
in perfect sympathy and understanding with Cis.
“So long. Much obliged, but it’s paid, both ways.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, but an ice cream cone does no
harm, and that’s outside your day’s wages,” retorted
Cis, letting him out. Then she turned to
Nan.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose she wants of me? Is it
to bless, or to curse me? I’ve got to go, couldn’t
refuse and wouldn’t want to, but at the same time
if you want to play my part I’ll lend you my
clothes, Nan,” she said.</p>

<p>Nan laughed; she would have tripped on Cis’s
skirt, short though skirts were, and fallen through
her jacket.</p>

<p>“Your clothes are not a good fit for me, Cis,
and I’d be less of a fit in your place at Miss Lucas’.
I’ll never be able to wait to hear what happens
there!” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Pity you’re on duty all this afternoon and
evening! But I’m going to Mass to-morrow, sure. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
you go to the eight I’ll meet you and tell you all
I know,” Cis suggested.</p>

<p>“All right; that’s fine!” Nan’s face brightened.
“It’s time I went home to lunch, if I’m to be at
the office by one. Remember, you’re to spend to-morrow
night with me. Oh, Cis! Your last
night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know! I look forward to many
more nights, Nanny, and some of them with you!”
laughed Cis, persistently cheerful.</p>

<p>Cis dressed for her call on Miss Jeanette Lucas
with more trepidation than she would have been
willing to acknowledge. She looked exceedingly
well in setting forth, all in white; plain-tailored
linen skirt; fine hand-wrought shirt-waist; a simple
white hat of soft straw, with a soft white bow on one
side its sole trimming; her masses of glowing, shining
red hair emphasized by its snowy setting.</p>

<p>Cis noted her effects in the mirror with approval.</p>

<p>“Not so bad, Cicely, my dear,” she said aloud.
“Neat, but not gaudy—except your hair! You’re
not in the least a beauty, but you look kept-together,
and I’m not ashamed to walk out with you,
Miss Adair!”</p>

<p>She nodded at her reflection in the glass, sighed
as she took up gloves, which she detested, and ran
downstairs, dreading her coming call, yet afraid of
being unpunctual.</p>

<p>The Lucas house stood back from the street behind
its tall trees, screened from its surroundings,
although its neighborhood was the best in town.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
“The old Lucas place” was a landmark, built
shortly after the building of the Republic; it had
been finished in time to entertain Lafayette when
he had returned to see the new order which his
youthful love of adventure had helped to establish
on the western continent. It had been deemed a
pity that the old estate was exposed to the danger
of ultimate transformation into a Roman Catholic
institution by the conversion of its present
owner to the Faith of France, a Faith which might
do very well for French heroes, born to it, but
did not do at all for unheroic Americans.</p>

<p>It was an unwarranted anxiety that apprehended
such a transformation for the stately house; besides
Jeanette, his oldest daughter, Robert Lucas had an
older married son, three younger boys and two
younger girls, so that heirs were not wanting to
save the house from a Sisterhood, nor was its neighborhood
falling off to bring about a desire on the
part of the Lucas family to sell it.</p>

<p>Cis went up its broad front walk to its wide,
simply beautiful front door, impressed and quieted
by the repose, the certainty of fundamental things,
which reached her even on the exterior of the
house.</p>

<p>A soft-footed, soft-voiced maid, with perfect
manners, responded to Cicely’s summons. She
said: “Please come in, Miss Adair. If you don’t
mind, will you go right up to Miss Jeanette’s room?
She is expecting you, and gave those orders. I will
show you the way.”</p>

<p>She led Cis up a long flight of stairs—the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
was remarkably high-ceiled—its steps low, mounting
at the easiest possible angle, yet with a broad
mahogany handrail to aid in progress. There was
a deep recessed landing more than half-way up, an
arched window lighting it, a splendid old clock
standing back against the wall in its corner.</p>

<p>The maid knocked on a door that stood slightly
ajar at the rear of the hall on the second floor, and
instantly pushed it open.</p>

<p>“Miss Adair, Miss Jeanette. I brought her right
up to you as you told me to,” she said.</p>

<p>The maid stepped back and withdrew down the
hall. A girl about Cicely’s age arose from a low
couch on which she had been reclining, and said,
speaking low, lifelessly, as if speaking were an
effort:</p>

<p>“Please come in, Miss Adair. You were kind to
come. Will you take this chair?”</p>

<p>She drew forward slightly a deep chair, softly
cushioned in dark blue, and herself dropped back
on the couch, sidewise among its piled pillows, not
lying down, but resting on her elbow. Yet, listless
though her attitude was, her left hand clutched the
corner of a pillow, wrinkling it tautly in a nervous
grasp.</p>

<p>She was dark eyed, dark haired; Cis thought that
she had never seen anyone so pale; her olive skin,
naturally beautiful in tint and texture, was almost
greenish in its livid tint; there were great circles
under her eyes which looked sunken, as if they had
been staring wide open into the dark for sleepless
nights. Cis forgot her embarrassment, her uneasiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
as to what might be before her because of her
share in what had befallen this girl, in an overwhelming
pity for the grief which had thus
wrecked her loveliness.</p>

<p>Miss Lucas suddenly spoke, clasping and twisting
her fingers, her hands thrust forward on her
knees, her eyes burning as they stared at Cis.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you before,” she said.</p>

<p>“I was introduced to you at a benefit for the
Orphans; I served cream. I didn’t expect you to
remember me,” Cis answered.</p>

<p>“You have a face to be remembered,” Jeanette
Lucas said. “We had hard work tracing you. We—I,
rather—wanted to find the girl who——” she
broke off; her low, husky notes gave way to a
strident tone in her voice. She waved her hands
as if she were throwing something away. “See
here, Miss Adair, we’ve got to talk frankly, as one
girl to another. There has been too much between
us to beat about the bush, to try for foolish, futile
disguises of speech.”</p>

<p>“I never like them,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Then—why did you do what you did? Do you
know—have you ever known—Herbert Dale?” demanded
Jeanette, speaking with such eagerness that
she could hardly enunciate.</p>

<p>“Never. I’ve seen him,” replied Cis.</p>

<p>“But you knew that night who he was; you knew
it was something concerning me nearly, horribly,
tragically nearly. How?”</p>

<p>“He called you often; we get used to voices and
ways on the wire, Miss Lucas. All the world knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
from the papers that you were to be married; that’s
easy to explain,” Cis answered gently.</p>

<p>“What was your motive? Why did you connect
me with that wire? Did you hate him, or me?”
asked Jeanette.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Lucas, why do you say that? Can’t
you see why I did it?” cried Cis distressed. “I’d
been admiring you; you’re so pretty, so fine, so
good, so stainless! It made me sick to think that
you might be walking into unhappiness, blind,
tricked. I did what I’d want done for me in your
place; I put you where you could know, and then
whatever you did, you’d do with your eyes open.
I wanted you to have a square deal, dear Miss
Lucas.”</p>

<p>“At first I loathed you, I would have punished
you,” cried Jeanette. “But even at first I knew
that I could not marry him. I tried to think I
could, that I’d be a St. Monica, but no, oh, no!
I could not see him; I could not think of him; he
was a painted mummy case that held another body,
not the body in which my heart was buried. It
was not hatred, it was worse—distrust, horror!
He was not only wicked, but he was deceiving. Oh,
Cicely Adair, when you put me on that wire you
killed innocent, poor young Jeanette Lucas! I
don’t know what it has done to me; I shall go on,
but never again the girl who answered your call
that awful night. We don’t lightly break a promise
to marry, we Catholics, but Father Lennon said
that I could not marry a man from whom I shrank
with horror. I am not going to marry. But I’m not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
blaming you. I have been blessing you through
long, black hours of day and night, all alike dark!
I should have died if I had discovered that my husband
was a liar, wicked. I thought that I should
cure his one defect, his indifference to religion. I
know now that he was false to all things, to me as
well as to God! Cicely Adair, you’re a Catholic
girl; remember this lesson when you think of marrying.
I am grateful to you, but, oh, I loved him,
I loved him, and he never lived! I can’t mourn
the loss of the man I loved; there was no such man.
You can put flowers on a grave. I myself am the
only grave I have: I am dead, but the man I loved
never lived. Oh, me, oh, me!”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Miss Lucas! Oh, I’m sorry!” cried
Cis, beginning to tremble.</p>

<p>“No! Be glad! I’m glad; indeed I am glad and
grateful that you saved me from worse! My father
never trusted Herbert Dale. Mother liked him,
but father was afraid. He blesses you for what you
did. It was fine for one girl to stand by another,
unknown girl like that! I sent for you to tell you
this. I hear the company found out, and dismissed
you. There was a fearful scene when I gave back
my ring and told Herbert that I knew him at last.
He guessed—not at first, but after a while; I’m too
dull to keep a secret against his experienced questioning—he
guessed how I found out. He swore
he’d have the girl dismissed who had put me on his
wire. I know that he succeeded. I am profoundly
sorry. I owe you what cannot be repaid, but—will
you let my father help you in some way? He told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
me to say to you, when I told him that I meant to
find you and thank you, that you would be still
more generous and unselfish than you’ve already
been, if you would let him help you to your feet
again. He said he would be honored in recommending
you to any position, a girl with such fine
kindness and loyalty and true standards as yours
are! Will you be frank with me, please, dear?
I’ve spoken to you without the thinnest veil over
my face!”</p>

<p>“Bless your dear, sweet soul!” cried Cis. “I’m
all right. I’m leaving town to-morrow, going to
seek my fortune, if you can imagine it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Are you? It’s worse than I thought,”
cried Jeanette aghast. “What a pity, what a
shame! And all for me, to save me from being a
wretched wife! How could you be so kind to me?
Indeed, indeed you must let us do something about
it!”</p>

<p>“Dear girl,” said Cis, leaning forward, taking
one of Jeanette’s burning hands in her firm, cool,
shapely ones, “you mustn’t take that hard. I’m a
restless fish; I’ve been wanting a change. I could
find a job here, but I’ve been wanting to go away.
I’m taking the chance the company’s given me to
pull up stakes; that’s all. I’m going Monday, to
Beaconhite, just for sport, so don’t you worry over
it, you dear!”</p>

<p>“Beaconhite? Oh, father could help you there!
His brother is the president of the biggest bank in
the city, and if you had a letter to him he’d give
you something splendid, I know he would! Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
you let father give you a letter to Uncle Wilmer?
Please, please say yes!” Jeanette pleaded with
hands and eyes, leaning forward eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll say yes!” laughed Cis. “And then I’ll
say thank you! It’ll be great not to be without a
plank on a new ocean. But all I ask is that you
and your father will quit feeling that you owe me
anything. I knew the company would drop me,
but that’s nothing! I tell you I’ve been fidgeting
lately. Anyway, what’s that beside marrying the
wrong sort? I’ve been fond of you this good while,
Miss Jeanette Lucas; I’ve taken comfort in making
believe I knew you, and that we were friends.
Funny, maybe, but all girls have sort of far-off
crushes, I guess! Then, when I’d a chance to be a
friend to you in good earnest, you’d better believe
I liked it! So that’s all there is to that, my dear!”</p>

<p>Jeanette looked at Cis hard and long, then she
leaned over to her and kissed her. “Strange,” she
said slowly. “You have come into my life deeply
with one stride. No other girl is bound up into
my life as you are. As long as I live I shall remember
you, the girl who saved me. I shall keep your
face, your wonderful red hair, in my mind when
I am old and feeble—if I live to be so! It doesn’t
seem as though I could go on living, but I know
people can’t die because they no longer really live.
We are friends, dear, and your sweet, queer dream
of me came true.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry about you, I ache,” said Cis simply.
“What are you going to do, what will become of
you? Don’t talk of dying!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Father is going to take me to Europe for six
months. That’s all I know of a future,” said Jeanette.
“I’m stunned; it doesn’t seem true most of
the time. Then it is the only truth in all the world,
and I reel under the feeling that all else, all I
trusted and believed, is false. I never knew wicked
people, and if the one who seemed noblest, best, is
treacherous, wicked, how do I know, how do I
know? I’m not easy to transplant, Cicely; my roots
won’t take hold again. But your clear, changing,
warm, pitying face looks true. My father and my
mother are good, good and dear! I must find my
way. Don’t you think I shall?”</p>

<p>“Stop brooding over it,” advised Cis, out of her
complete ignorance. “There’s not a man born
worth worrying over. Set it down to experience,
and quit thinking of it.” Jeanette looked at her
wondering, then a faint smile passed over her face,
hardly more than the shadow of one, but Cis rejoiced
in it.</p>

<p>“That’s good advice, dear,” she said quietly.
“But if you have poured yourself, all of yourself,
your life and all its parts, into one vessel and it is
broken—how do you go on, how gather it all up,
into what? Tell me this, brave, wise, ignorant
Cicely Adair! Don’t love anyone, Cicely; it hurts!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cicely, “I hope I sha’n’t. I like
people lots, but I never wanted anyone so I lay
awake five minutes wanting them. I must go now.
You’ve been mighty good to me. I was afraid you
might almost hate me. I think I could love you.”</p>

<p>“You could love someone, and find it as hard as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
I do; you are the sort that can love,” said Jeanette.
“I think I’m fond of you, Cicely Adair. I’m too
numb to feel anything but the one pain that absorbs
me, but I’m sure I’m fond of you. Father
will send that letter to you to-morrow. I’m glad it’s
to be Beaconhite, where he can introduce you, but
I’m sorry, sorry you are suffering through me.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! I love to go, honest! I was
brought up by strangers; my mother died long ago;
I live in lodgings; what’s the difference? Good-bye,
you dear, dear, lovely Miss Lucas! Go to
sleep; you look all in. When I think I made you
look like that——”</p>

<p>Jeanette shook her head, and took both of
Cicely’s hands.</p>

<p>“It was a blessed deed, dear,” she said. “I sent
for you to tell you I’m grateful; not to thank you,
because I can’t. We are friends, Cicely. We can’t
be parting for always; we have been drawn too
close. Will you let me know what happens to
you, if letters aren’t too burdensome to you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, if you care,” said Cis. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Jeanette followed Cis to the head of the stairs,
and rang for the maid to show her out. Cis looked
back, smiling up and waving her hand half-way
down.</p>

<p>Jeanette leaned over the broad mahogany rail,
her soft silken negligée drawn around her, her eyes
burning in their pallid setting, her dark hair
loosely shading her face, her white lips pitifully
pulled into a smile for Cicely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Cicely, boyish, unscathed by suffering or desire,
yet knew that the girl, Jeanette Lucas, whom she
had idealized, had died under that surgery by
which she had cut off from her what would have
slain her.</p>

<p>Cis walked slowly down the street, pondering
the mystery of this contradictory truth.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

TRANSPLANTING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CIS spent her last night before setting out to
try her fortune, Sunday night, with Nan in
the Dowling, pleasant, somewhat crowded little
house.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas had sent to Cicely the letter of introduction
to his brother in Beaconhite, promised
her by Jeanette. Briefly, but forcibly, it expressed
Mr. Lucas’ conviction that Cicely Adair was a person
whose ability and fidelity were of the highest
order; that he, therefore, felt no hesitation in
asking his brother to place her to her advantage, in
acknowledgment of a debt which Mr. Lucas owed
her and which he did not hope ever fully to cancel.</p>

<p>Cis read the unsealed letter with an elated sense
of being armed to meet her new, experimental venture,
and hurried around the corner to the public
telephone station to call up Miss Lucas, thank her
and her father, and tell her that now she knew
that she was all right, though she had never been
fearful, and to bid Miss Lucas good-bye again, with
the injunction not to worry over her. “Or anything
else,” Cis added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Then she went back to her lodgings, finished
putting into her suitcase the articles which she
needed for that night and her first night in Beaconhite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
took a quick, humorous survey of her room,
which embraced its every detail, and waved her
hand to it, nodding farewell.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, good luck, friend Room,” she said.
“You’re not much of a home, but you’ve been mine
over two years. Hope you get on well with your
new chum, and get dusted regularly, and that she
won’t make a fuss over that loose board, nor the
broken blind fastening. Wonder if I’ll sleep as
well in my new room as I’ve slept in you? One
thing, I’ve never in my life had anything to keep
me awake nights, so far!”</p>

<p>She took up the suitcase, waiting beside her—it
was not light, though it held no heavy articles,
but there never was a light suitcase, however
packed—and went down the stairs.</p>

<p>Her landlady was awaiting her; she came out of
the dining room when she heard Cis’s step, to wish
her good luck and bid her good-bye.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t be sorry, Miss Adair,” she
said, without any indication that she considered the
hope well-founded. “Personally, I think no one
could find a better place than the city we live in,
but maybe Beaconhite ain’t so bad. You’ve been
a good lodger; always pleasant; prompt with your
payments; reg’lar in hours, and you never abused
the light priv’lege with an iron, or any such. I’m
sorry to lose you; I can truthf’ly say that much,
and I wish you well, wherever it may be.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Miss Spencer. We’ve got on fine, take
it as a whole, and I hope the next one in my room
may be taken wholier—holier might easily mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
two things!” laughed Cis. “Good-bye, good luck!
Look after the cat; I like that cat, and she’ll miss
my petting. Animals need more than mere food.
Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Now I’m launched!” thought Cis, going off
down the street, having shut the front door for
the last time with her customary vigorous slam.
“No, I’m not! Supper at Dowlings’ and the night
there first, then I’ll really be launched! I like Nan
heaps, but her mother is quite advice-full!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dowling was not perfectly sure about Cis,
as Cis was sharp enough to perceive. She did not
like her indifferent brand of Catholicity, but aside
from that, she found nothing to condemn in the
girl, or had not so far. “So far” summed up Mrs.
Dowling’s attitude toward Cicely; when Nan told
her mother that she knew no other girl so intrinsically
upright and pure-minded, Mrs. Dowling always
said: “I hope she is!” and Nan was helpless
to defend Cis against a charitable hope, however
dubiously expressed.</p>

<p>Cis was too attractive to men to be wholly trustworthy,
Mrs. Dowling felt, with the bias of the
rather dull woman who has married the one man
who ever noticed her. She could not understand
the vivacity that drew others, combined with the
nature that allowed no one to pass within definite
barriers.</p>

<p>Then young Tom Dowling, only a year and a
half Cicely’s junior, found her far too charming;
it was bad enough that Nan was her humble adorer,
but Tom was another matter. Mrs. Dowling was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
one of the many women who mistake jealousy for
love of their children. Down in the bottom of her
heart, Mrs. Dowling felt sure that the act of Providence
which removed Cicely Adair from her present
field was easily understood, corroborative of
her secret misgivings.</p>

<p>Nan and Cicely were bedfellows that last night;
like true girls they talked far into it of their views,
their hopes, Cicely’s adventure, of Jeanette Lucas
and the risks and promises of marriage.</p>

<p>Cis declared that she did not want to marry, nor
ever would marry unless there came into her life
a man who so filled it that she would be maimed
and crippled, lacking him. That man, she added,
she did not believe existed. Cis felt self-sufficient,
rejoicing in her ability to take care of herself.</p>

<p>Nan, on the other hand, did not mind acknowledging
that she thought that she could be quite fond
enough of a man to marry him and be happy with
him without a cataclysmic passion; he must be
good, she added, like a wise little second Eve, because,
chiefly, she hoped that she would have many
children and she would want their father to be an
example to them.</p>

<p>Cis laughed aloud at this, and Nan smothered
the laugh in the bedclothes, fearing to disturb her
mother at one o’clock.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe many girls pick out a man for
the sake of their children; I’m dead sure I’d pick
him for myself,” declared Cis.</p>

<p>“I don’t care; they ought to,” maintained Nan
stoutly. “How can you bring up children well if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
their father is bad? And if he’s a good father,
he’ll make his wife happy. All women are first
of all mothers of souls, like the first woman.”</p>

<p>She admitted to Cicely’s gleeful questioning that
she had derived this idea from a mission sermon;
in return for which admission Cicely admitted that
she had no doubt it was quite right; that she
couldn’t object to it as long as she herself didn’t
have to marry posterity’s ancestor.</p>

<p>Breakfast was somewhat hurried. Beaconhite
was distant over a hundred miles, but its inaccessibility
counted for more hours’ travelling
than the miles. To reach it Cis must go to New
York; cross there to another railway station, and
start again for her destination, therefore she was
to take an early train to New York.</p>

<p>Tom and Nan were going to see her off. Mrs.
Dowling put up a delicious lunch for Cis, and
gave it to her with the utmost kindness, and much
excellent advice as to conditions and conduct of
which young Cicely, accustomed to the world and
to make her way in it from her childhood, knew
ten times as much as the older woman, and had
practically and instinctively formulated her own
rules.</p>

<p>“And, my dear,” Mrs. Dowling ended, “I wish
you’d at once go and call on some fine priest, get
him interested in you. You’re a girl that needs
it, though all do who are alone like you. And
where’ll you stay to-night, till you find a nice room,
in a decent house? And how’ll you know what
any house’s like in a new place, unless you call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
on the priest and he sends you to the right one?
You can’t be too careful, Cicely; you heed what
one who is old enough to be your mother tells
you.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t know what to say to the priest if
I called on him, Mrs. Dowling,” laughed Cis. “I’ll
stay at a hotel, pick out a good one. I’ve made up
my mind to take a week off, not present my letter
to that other Mr. Lucas for a bit. I’ll get a hotel
for five dollars a day, I’m sure, and I’ve decided
to spend thirty-five dollars on myself laying off,
sizing up Beaconhite for a week. Then I’ll roll
up my sleeves and pitch in. I may get acquainted
with some decent young fellow of my own age.
You take a risk when you pick up a girl, but with
a boy you don’t. Then a boy never misunderstands
you; you can be honest and friendly with a boy,
and he’ll always see it if you’re straight, and play
right up to you, good chum-fashion, not looking for
trouble, nor for anything behind your jolly good
times. I’ll try to find a nice boy, first, in Beaconhite
and he can steer me to his sister, or his cousins,
and other girls. Isn’t that all so, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Cis!” cried Tom. “Fellows
know what girls mean—worse luck! It wouldn’t
be half-bad if a chap couldn’t always dope you out
so easy.”</p>

<p>“Cicely Adair, I wish you had a mother!” cried
Mrs. Dowling.</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose I do?” Cis exclaimed. “The
right sort; but we always think our mother would
have been the right sort, if we’d had her, of course!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
You’ve been kind, Mrs. Dowling; indeed I thank
you for it. Don’t worry about me. I don’t believe
I’ll take a plunge; I sort of believe in my
luck. I’m going to keep in mind that I’ve got to
be the old maid godmother to Nan’s children, and
that she’ll expect a perfect lady for the part!
Isn’t it time we were getting off, children? If you
make me lose that train you can stop down in town
and order crepe for your mother to put on!”</p>

<p>“Loads of time, Cis,” said Tom. “However, we
may as well mosey along. No use putting off amputation;
hurts any time.”</p>

<p>He picked up Cicely’s suitcase, went outside,
pulling his hat down over his eyes, to wait with a
gloomy face while Cis bade good-bye to his mother
and the rest of his family.</p>

<p>“Rotten! No sense in her going!” muttered Tom
under his breath.</p>

<p>At the station there were many others waiting
to see Cicely Adair on her way.</p>

<p>Young Tom had no chance for a tender leave-taking,
for which Cis was devoutly grateful. Now
that the time to go had come, Cis found herself
moved by the parting. After all, one’s native place
and lifelong acquaintances mean a great deal, even
to self-confident youth.</p>

<p>Cis wrapped little Nan in a close embrace and
her bright eyes were dimmed by the tears which
did not fall; Cis was not a crying girl. Nan wept
aloud, in spite of Cis’s promise to return.</p>

<p>“You’ll never come back, not the same, anyway.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
We’re too young to part and join on again without
changes,” sobbed Nan, unexpectedly far-seeing.</p>

<p>Cis settled into her seat next the window with
a long breath of relief; she disliked feeling emotionally
upset, it puzzled her and offended her
with herself; she was unaccustomed to distress of
mind.</p>

<p>She took off her small close hat, rumpled her
bright locks which it had flattened, and leaned her
head against the window to watch obliquely as long
as she could see them, those whom she was leaving.
Then, when the last handkerchief and waving straw
hat had been lost to view, Cis burrowed in her
hand-bag for a tiny powder box and puff, held
up a small mirror and dusted her eyelids and the
tip of her nose, restored the vanity articles to their
place, pulled a magazine from the straps of
the suitcase at her feet, selected the box of candy
of the five beside her which promised her keenest
pleasure, and settled herself for the journey to
New York. If there were no use in crying over
spilled milk, neither was there any use in spilling
tears over partings which she herself had chosen
should occur.</p>

<p>It was half after four that afternoon when Cis
found herself being pulled slowly into the station
of the city which she had selected as the scene of
her winter residence, chiefly on the whimsical
ground that it spelled its name Beaconhite when
it obviously should have been Beaconheight.</p>

<p>There was a better approach to this small city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of some hundred thousand inhabitants than is
commonly found along railway tracks, and the
station, with its roofed-over platforms covering outlying
tracks, and flower beds along its banks at
either end, was attractive.</p>

<p>“You look quite spiffy, Beaconhite, my dear, but
handsome is as handsome does; we’ll wait to find
out what you do to me!” thought Cis, playing with
herself after her usual fashion.</p>

<p>Cis “grabbed a bus in the dark,” as she told herself,
one of three which bore the names of
hotels, this one being “The Beacon Head,”
which hit Cis’s fancy: it chanced to be the best
hotel in town; not the most pretentious, but the
most dignified and well-conducted.</p>

<p>“Luck’s holding!” thought Cis, having registered
and been assigned a room at her limit of price, and
finding the room comfortable, well-furnished, its
two windows giving, one on an enclosed court, but
the other on the main street.</p>

<p>Cis went to bed early, after a remarkably well-cooked,
nicely served dinner. She debated going
out in search of amusement, but decided for early
sleep and a long night.</p>

<p>“If you re going to spend a week loafing, my
girl, you’ll have a hard enough job putting in the
time, and when you’ve got to work at enjoying
yourself, don’t make the job harder by plunging
the first night, using up scanty materials for fun,”
she advised herself, taking the lift to her room on
the second floor merely for the luxury of it, though
she preferred walking up stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Cis awoke early, thoroughly refreshed, but she
carried out her principle of compelling herself to
be luxurious by not rising till after eight. Then,
bath and breakfast over, she sallied out to see the
city.</p>

<p>Cis found Beaconhite greatly to her liking; she
came back to the Beacon Head with a good appetite,
and the conviction that here she should like to
stay. She would not defer presenting her letter
of introduction till the end of the week; she would
present it to Mr. Wilmer Lucas the day after to-morrow.
It was not likely that she would at once
step into employment; she must allow time for a
position to be found for her, so she would be prudent,
and use her introduction sooner than she had
intended doing. In reality, one forenoon of luxurious
idleness had shown active Cis that many
days so spent would undermine her spirits and her
patience.</p>

<p>On the third day after her arrival in Beaconhite,
Cis made herself trig and trim in the well-cut
suit which she was wearing that summer, with
a fine fresh shirt-waist, and her simple white hat.
She had dressed carefully and looked her best; she
sallied forth to call on Mr. Wilmer Lucas less hopeful
than confident.</p>

<p>She found the bank of which Mr. Lucas was
president, to which Jeanette Lucas had directed her
to find her uncle, a really impressively magnificent
building, its furnishings and finish declaring its
assets; its architecture and material announcing its
security. Mr. Lucas, she was told, did not come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to the bank every day; this was one of the mornings
on which he was to be found in his law office.
It was not far from the bank; Cis turned her steps
thither, and was shown into Mr. Lucas’ private
office after a sufficient time had elapsed for him
to read the introductory letter from his brother,
which Cis sent in to him by the messenger who
came forward to her in the outer office.</p>

<p>“Miss Adair?” said Mr. Lucas as Cis entered.
“My brother has spoken of you in the highest
terms, as you probably know. Will you be seated,
if you please?”</p>

<p>Cis took the straight chair before the desk, so
placed as to give Mr. Lucas the advantage of the
light from the window above it, full on her face.
He looked at her keenly, and what he saw seemed
to satisfy him, for he nodded almost imperceptibly,
with a softening of his glance that betokened acceptance
of Cis. Cis’s bright, irregular face, with
its straightforward look of humorous kindliness
invariably won for her friends, and, from elder,
experienced people, appraisal and trust.</p>

<p>Cis on her part saw a man older than the Mr.
Lucas whom she had often seen at her home; a
large man, greyed around the temples, with a face
that was harder than his brother’s face; an intellectual
face that might reveal selfishness, but did
not indicate self-indulgence. Cis felt a little afraid
of him, yet to herself she characterized him as “the
real thing,” and decided that it would be agreeable
to be in the employ of such a fine gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“My brother tells me that you would like a position,
Miss Adair, or implies that. What can you
do?” Mr. Lucas asked.</p>

<p>“I write a clear hand, that can be read; I am
quick at figures; I know shorthand and can type.
I can do as I’m told,” Cis added the final statement
with a twist of her lips, a sudden, crooked
little smile that revealed her strong white teeth.</p>

<p>“Great virtue, that last,” commented Mr. Lucas,
his eyes reflecting Cis’s smile.</p>

<p>“My brother speaks of his obligation to you;
may I ask in what way you have put my brother
under obligations to you?”</p>

<p>Cis shook her head. “Sorry, Mr. Lucas, but that
can’t come into my dealing with you, if I’m lucky
enough to deal with you. It wasn’t such a great
obligation; it wasn’t doing anything worth talking
about, but you’ll see that I can’t talk about other
people’s affairs, even your brother’s, or—” Cis
caught herself up short.</p>

<p>“‘Or’? Well, Miss Adair, I suppose that you
are within your rights in refusing to answer me,
but you will see that I, also, have rights; that I
should know all about a person whom I employ?”
said Mr. Lucas.</p>

<p>“It’s not so much within my rights, Mr. Lucas,
as within my duty,” said Cis, with her sunny smile
of good fellowship, as if she expected Mr. Lucas
to understand and sympathize with her. “I’ll tell
you anything under the sun that you want to know
about myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Why have you left your home? Why were you
not able to find employment there?” asked Mr.
Lucas, his voice intentionally made harsher.</p>

<p>“I left my home for no reason at all, just because
I wanted to shake myself. I think I could
have found employment there; I didn’t try. I
wanted a change,” said Cis promptly. “But I’m
going to tell you that I was employed in the Telephone
Exchange and was dismissed for breaking
an important rule. So now you know the worst
they’d tell you of me at home.”</p>

<p>“Broke an important rule? Yet you this moment
told me you could obey. Did you break it
deliberately?” demanded Mr. Lucas.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Lucas, and I knew they’d bounce—dismiss
me. Please don’t ask anything more about
it, because the rest of it doesn’t concern me; it
concerns someone else.” Cis looked at Mr. Lucas
appealingly, yet with a frank certainty that he
would trust her.</p>

<p>“H’m,” Mr. Lucas murmured. “I am a lawyer,
Miss Adair; my specialty is collecting and weighing
evidence for my firm. Let me see: You were
a telephone girl; you broke an important rule; you
were dismissed, as you foresaw that you would be
for that disobedience; my brother feels profoundly
indebted to you; his daughter, Jeanette, is the very
core of his heart; she was to have been married
shortly; she is not to be married, I hear; she discovered
that her lover was perfidious, unworthy;
how did she discover it? Heh?” He bent his keen
eyes, frowningly, upon Cis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“The newspapers said that the marriage was off;
they didn’t tell us anything else about it,” said
Cis, but she turned crimson and looked alarmed.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see my niece, Jeanette Lucas?”
persisted Mr. Lucas, and as Cis nodded, he added:
“Lovely girl, lovely in mind as well as body!”</p>

<p>“I saw her at a bazaar, spoke to her, and I’ve
loved her ever since; she’s the loveliest thing!”
cried Cis fervently, then stopped, confused as she
saw Jeanette’s uncle smile.</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Adair,” he said, pushing over
some papers on his table and leaning back in his
chair as if to indicate the end of the interview.
“I will see about your application. I suppose you
are applying for a position with me? I may tell
you that I need someone who can be trusted, rather
unusually trusted, with matters which must be
absolutely and completely buried within these
walls. I need a confidential clerk who will take
down notes for me, write letters, and whose honor
must be beyond suspicion, beyond the reach of
temptation by bribery or cajoling, whose discretion
must be equal to her—or his—honor. I may say
that I am inclined to forecast the use of the feminine
pronoun; it has been my experience that
women are loyal to the death, if they are capable
of loyalty at all, and that, when they are to be
trusted, there is less danger of advantageous offers
to betray winning them over, than there is of men’s
being so led away. If I took you on could you
begin next Monday?”</p>

<p>“That would just suit me. I thought I’d like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a week off before I took up anything, though it’s
going to be long enough, too!” Cis laughed at
herself.</p>

<p>“Habits are our masters, Miss Adair; work gets
its iron hold on us quite as tight as any other
vice,” observed Mr. Lucas. “Learn to loaf while
you’re still young.”</p>

<p>To his satisfaction Cis laughed up at him—they
had both risen—her eyes spilling over fun, her
lips parted, a hitherto unrevealed dimple appearing
in one cheek.</p>

<p>His solemn warning was not mistaken by her for
serious earnest.</p>

<p>“I think she will do; I think Robert has estimated
her justly. She would not tell me anything
that might betray confidence, or her inside knowledge
of the other Lucas family’s affairs. I need
a girl who can hold her tongue, and be loyal.
Somehow, she is the source of Jeanette’s discovery
of her lover’s perfidy. I think she’ll do exceedingly
well.”</p>

<p>These thoughts ran through Mr. Lucas’ mind as
he politely bowed Cis out of his office, but all that
he said to her was:</p>

<p>“You shall hear from me not later than Saturday.
At the Beacon Head? I see you wrote that
address on the envelope which you sent in to me.
Good morning, Miss Adair. Not later than Saturday;
sooner, I think. Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Luck still running strong, Cis dear!” Cis gaily
told herself as she walked fast away from the office.
“He’s going to take you on. He’s like a duke and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the Tower of London, combined with a magnifying
glass which shows how you’re working inside, but
I think I’ll like the combination, especially the
duke part of it! I must go back and write Nan
all about it; she’ll be worrying over lucky me,
little goose!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

THE PINCH OF NECESSITY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY FRIDAY of the week of her arrival in
Beaconhite, Cis found herself a burden on
her own hands. Five days of what had become
compulsory idleness and pursuit of pleasure, were
too many for the nerves of active Cis Adair, trained
by her lifelong habit into ways of industry.</p>

<p>Beaconhite did not offer enthralling pleasure to
dwellers on its surface. There were theatres, one
principal one, two insignificant ones, a vaudeville
house, but even to the best of these, first-class
companies did not come; this week the third-class
company which was giving a metropolitan success
for six nights and a matinée in Beaconhite, had
already been seen by Cis when they were doing
the same thing in her native city. There were
“movies,” but Cis happened to be one of those
persons to whom silent drama is annoying; she
wanted the spoken line, and disliked the necessary
exaggeration of the pictures. She went one night
to see again the play which she had already seen,
and another night to the moving pictures; here she
found a film showing, which she had seen twice
before, and this, added to her dislike for this form
of entertainment, sent her back to her hotel in a
bad temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>She had hoped to hear from Mr. Wilmer Lucas
by this time, founding the hope upon his suggestion
that he might communicate with her before
Saturday, but no word came from him.</p>

<p>“Looking up my record at home, maybe, though
Mr. Robert Lucas’ letter ought to be enough for
him,” thought Cis. “Goodness, if he shouldn’t
take me at all! I’ll be dippy if I hang around
after Monday; all I can do to hold out till then!
If I don’t get into Mr. Lucas’ office, I’ll have to
take a job at anything, good or bad; I’ll kick the
stall out if I’m left standing any longer. Besides,
I can’t stay on at $5.00 per, at the Beacon Head
longer than that; $35.00 is my limit to spend on
loafing—and I haven’t had my money’s worth so
far!”</p>

<p>Cis realized, as she had not done, how much she
had depended upon companionship. She had
earned her living among girls, some of whom she
had liked, some disliked, to the great majority of
whom she had been indifferent; but they were
quick-witted, full of life and spirits; “they kept
things moving,” Cis told herself, and the days
spent without anyone to speak to except a hotel
clerk, a chambermaid, waiter and bell boy, grew
oppressive.</p>

<p>Cis tried to talk to some of the attractive girls
who were always to be met in the lobby, the elevator,
in the dining room, but all of them froze
up when she made advances to them; all but one
replied to her small talk, but replied so forbiddingly
that Cis did not persist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Afraid I may be the wrong sort and that it’ll
come off!” thought Cis. “Idiots! How do you
ever get anywhere in this world if you tote a shell
around, like a snail? Miss a lot if you don’t try
people out first, and freeze up afterward, provided
you find them the kind that needs dropping! I
wanted to jar poor Mrs. Dowling when I said
what I did about picking up boy acquaintances,
but it’s the truth, nevertheless. I’m going to
look around for a nice fellow and try him out,
see if he won’t be bold enough to risk a decent
answer. I’ve got to get someone started, that’s
sure! This hotel and town are getting to feel like
a diving bell, ’way down below human noises.”</p>

<p>With deliberate intention to carry out her plan,
purvey to her need, Cis scanned the male portion
of her fellow-guests in the hotel for the rest of
that day and evening, but none measured up to
her requirement. They were a lot of average
young Americans, but the frank face, the businesslike
air, the quality of manliness that conveyed
the ability to understand and meet her like a
fellow-being, not like a girl seeking attentions,
seemed to Cis wanting to them all.</p>

<p>She went to bed lonely and discouraged, somewhat
inclined to tears, but so healthy-minded that
she quickly fell asleep instead of crying. Her last
waking thought was that if Beaconhite showed her
no jolly, sensible girls, no friendly, chummy boys,
it was no place for Cis Adair, and that she might
move on by Monday, Mr. Lucas or no Mr. Lucas.</p>

<p>Friday morning found Cis refreshed and ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to postpone her decision to move on, also quite
sure that before the day was over she should hear
from Mr. Lucas that he was ready to test her in
the highly honorable position of his confidential
clerk. Therefore her merry face was as bright as
ever when she had finished her toilette and came
down to breakfast like a sun maiden, all in white,
her red hair gloriously shining above her snowy
raiment.</p>

<p>Two young men breakfasting together looked
smilingly up at Cis as she passed their table, unmistakably
ready to leap out into acquaintances at
the least sign of welcome from her; indeed one
of them slightly pushed out the chair next to him,
leaning forward with an ingratiating smile. Cis
knew the type and “had no time for it,” she would
have said. “Call themselves men!” Cis once had
exclaimed to Nan.</p>

<p>After her solitary breakfast, which she enjoyed
as a hungry girl should, Cis turned her mind upon
the problem of how to dispose of that day; she
found it insoluble. “May as well take a trolley
and ride till it stops, but of all stupid things,
sliding along past a lot of houses is the worst!
Wish I had my bunch of little newsys here! Wonder
if they miss me badly, poor little scraps! I
made Tom Dowling promise he’d do something
for them.”</p>

<p>Cis left the dining room and went to the desk.
Here she found two letters in the pigeonhole that
bore the number of her room, but neither was
from Mr. Lucas, as she had been sure one must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
be. There was a brief note from Jeanette Lucas
in reply to one which Cis had written her, telling
her that she had seen her uncle and that he held
out hope of a position for her. Miss Lucas said
nothing of herself beyond that she was to sail for
Europe the following week. She wrote to Cis with
much more than the politeness of a slight acquaintance;
the short note breathed warmth of feeling
for Cis, and a personal sadness that depressed Cis,
though she could not have said wherein it lay.</p>

<p>The other letter was a long one from Nan, full
of love and longing for Cis, and all the trivial
news of the office, her home, their common acquaintances,
which are such important items to an
exile, just because they are so homely and unimportant.
Cis folded this letter and slipped it into
her pocket with homesick heaviness of heart that
surprised her. “Of course there’s nothing to prevent
me from going back if I want to,” she reminded
herself.</p>

<p>Deciding against the trolley trip, Cis arose from
the leather seat upon which she had been sitting,
and began to stroll up and down the lobby, and
down its adjacent corridors, returning on her beat.
One of the corridors had shop-like rooms up and
down its length, rented for various sorts of business—a
little toy shop, candy shop, book shop,
flower shop, a shop for fancy work materials, all
sorts of attractive things offered for sale; while
a manicure, a chiropodist, a barber and a bootblack
were lodged there, in their respective rooms, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
minister to the personal comfort of the patrons of
the hotel, and people from beyond its walls.</p>

<p>The bootblack’s establishment especially attracted
Cis’s eye; it was the apotheosis of the elevated
chair and foot rest and the active little Italian
ministrant, to be found on street corners. Here
were several chairs, better said, thrones; the walls
were panelled in attractive colors; there were
hangings of deep yellow, framing the casement of
the door and one window at the rear; a table, with
papers and magazines upon it, in its centre a well-shaped
vase holding two perfect yellow roses.</p>

<p>Cis looked into this palace of charity to wayworn
shoes, admiring its perfection. There were two
or three assistants at work on as many customers,
and there were two other customers waiting to
have their shoes polished. In a chair unmistakably
comfortable sat one of these waiting customers;
he was reading a magazine. As Cis loitered,
looking in at the open door from the hotel corridor,
this customer turned over his magazine,
which he held doubled over for convenience in
reading it, and his eyes met Cis’s eyes.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly good looking, dark haired,
blue eyed, fresh tinted, with well-cut features, but
it was not for his good looks that Cis instantly
decided that here was the person for whom she
had been seeking. It was rather for an indescribable
air of man of the world about him; the
ease of his excellent clothes and their manner of
wearing; his steady, unembarrassed gaze, that did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
not intrude upon her, yet seemed to take Cis in
as to her every detail, to approve her and like her,
be ready to meet her friendliness on its own
ground; “be a human being,” Cis would have
summed it up. But there was no denying that this
young man possessed decided good looks and instant
charm which were not a necessary part of
the qualifications upon which Cis had insisted as
a part of the outfit of the person whom she should
adopt as the one who should make her wilderness
blossom with comradery.</p>

<p>Cis Adair had never hesitated to take anything
that she wanted, nor, if it did not come after her,
to go out after it. She had never wanted anything
that was forbidden by the highest, nor the
lower laws, but she invariably reached out after
what she wanted. Now she glanced down at her
shoes, which were shapely, fine as to leather, and
which she decided were enough in need of polishing
to warrant her treating them to it. She entered
the attractive shop.</p>

<p>The customers happened at that moment to be
all men, but Cis had no shyness with men; she
was nearer to shy with women. She came in without
embarrassment, though every eye turned on
her. The young man who had innocently trolled
her hither at once got upon his feet; the other waiting
customer did not move.</p>

<p>“This is the most comfortable chair,” he said,
indicating the one which he had just vacated for
Cis. “Please take it; I’ll sit here.” He dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
into the chair next beyond his former one, which
Cis took with a hearty “Thank you,” and a bright
smile. His voice was quite beautiful, soft, rich,
mellow, caressing, like a musical cadence, as he
spoke these few words.</p>

<p>“I never saw a bootblacking place like this,” Cis
commented.</p>

<p>“No. There can’t be many as nice. There’s
one in Chicago that—well, we won’t say it is better,
because we ought to be loyal to our own city,
but it’s by way of peachiness,” said the young man,
and his smile was as gay and bright as Cis’s own,
and it revealed two dimples to her one.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to be loyal to Beaconhite,” said
Cis. “I’m a stranger, staying in this hotel, but I
don’t mind sticking up for its bootblack.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you’d be good at sticking up for anything
that you felt belonged to you,” said the
young man, and Cis suddenly perceived that he
was not as young a man as she had at first thought
him. His brilliant coloring, his grace and charm
gave him the effect of greater youth than was his.
Cis decided that he was well on in his twenties,
if not just beyond them, and this somewhat checked
her readiness to take him on in the capacity of good
fellowship. Yet this was silly, she told herself;
a good fellow was one at any age. What did it
matter if this one were anywhere from five to ten
years her senior?</p>

<p>“You aren’t a Beaconhitette then?” he went on.
“That’s hard luck. Now I am. I wasn’t always;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
came here last year, in fact, but I’m living here, and
may go on living here, till I cease living altogether.
You’re a jolly girl; you ought to stay.”</p>

<p>His eyes were keen on Cis’s face, handsome eyes,
softly blue, somewhat veiled by dark lashes, yet
seeing eyes that could be keen as they now were,
studying this singular girl who was so ready to talk,
yet did not strike him as bold, but rather as
maidenly. “Boyish sort, I think, but you never can
be sure of them at first,” thought the man.</p>

<p>“I may stay on,” Cis was answering meanwhile.
“I came to stay, if things worked out; got tired of
the place where I’d always lived, and jumped off.
I’ve a letter to Mr. Lucas, here, and he may have
a position for me by Monday.”</p>

<p>“You’re one of the independent army, then?”
asked the young man. “Well, you don’t look like a
pampered, spoiled one! (This partly explains
her”) he thought. “Do you mean Wilmer Lucas?
Dear me! Your letter was addressed high up in
the line of this town; Wilmer Lucas is <i>the</i> big man
of Beaconhite!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way he struck me,” agreed Cis.
“There’s a chair vacant for you.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; you take it,” protested the young
man.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! You were here first; I’m not
one of the sort that wants to grab privilege, because
I’m a girl. I’m in the world like a man, and I like
give and take; straight play. Besides, I’m just killing
time; I’ve nowhere to go, nothing to do till I
get my position—if I do!” said Cis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>The young man glanced down at Cis’s shoes,
which were not badly in need of polishing. He
was far too attractive not to have known long ago
that women liked to talk to him, admired his face
and manner. Had this girl come in because she
saw him, and wanted to make the acquaintance of
so personable a young man? She had said that she
was killing time. He speculated upon Cis while he
took the chair which she refused, and the attendant
treated his shoes, which sadly needed it.</p>

<p>The next chair vacated was Cis’s in justice; the
other man who had been waiting a turn had preceded
Cis’s acquaintance; his shoes had been attended
to and he had quickly gone out.</p>

<p>Cis mounted her chair, and another attendant
dressed and polished her shoes, which her neighbor
and acquaintance viewed with approval.</p>

<p>He was through before Cis, but he lingered; in
an instant, after hesitating, he turned to her, and
said:</p>

<p>“You are merely killing time, and I’ve nothing
on this morning; I’m going to wait for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice of you!” cried Cis heartily. “I
hoped you would. It’s pretty punk being alone, a
stranger in a strange land.”</p>

<p>She paid her charge, dismounted, and went out
into the hotel corridor, followed by her new acquaintance,
still somewhat uncertain how to take
Cis, but considerably helped in an accurate estimate
of her by the boyish frankness with which she
had acknowledged hoping that he would wait for
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“How about going into the tea room and fitting
on our labels?” suggested the young man. “There’s
not likely to be anyone there at this hour, and I
feel it in my bones that we’ve not met just to part,
so we ought to waste no time in learning whom
we’ve met, each of us. Names matter less; they’re
only labels, but I’d like to have you tell me all
about yourself. You’re not like most girls.”</p>

<p>“All right; tea room is all right,” assented Cis.
“It won’t take me long to tell you about Cecily
Adair; she’s <i>just</i> like other girls!”</p>

<p>“That’s never your name! Why it’s a song!”
cried the young man.</p>

<p>“Mine, though!” laughed Cis. “I’m called Cis.
Haven’t you a name; chorus or hymn, if mine’s a
song?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s just a name, nothing in the musical
line. Hope you don’t mind names parted in the
middle? My name is George Rodney Moore, but
I use the middle name, sign G. Rodney, you know,”
said the young man, and he looked as if he really
hoped that Cis would not disapprove his name.</p>

<p>“Gee! Rodney!” cried Cis, but quickly added,
as if she feared to hurt him by what was not ridicule,
but unavoidable nonsense:</p>

<p>“Rodney is a fine name; I like it. I don’t blame
you for shedding the George, and using it. I suppose
I’d drop George altogether, and keep only Rodney,
but you can do that later, if you want to. Oh,
do you like stuffy tea rooms? Why not go out into
the air—that is, if you really want to lighten my
gloom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“It’s the other way about, Miss Adair. I should
like being out on this fine day, but you surely have
been taught by this time that you are sent into the
world to lighten the gloom of any man whom you
will tolerate,” G. Rodney Moore said experimentally.</p>

<p>They had turned toward the side entrance of the
hotel; in the doorway Cis stopped short.</p>

<p>“See here, none of that; cut it out, if you please,”
she said. “I like boys, but I don’t like them one
bit when they forget I’m not one, and you wouldn’t
say that sort of thing to a boy, now would you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m free to confess that I would not!” cried
Moore, and he chuckled. “All right, old chap,
you’re the kind that makes it jolly for a pal—better?”</p>

<p>“Heaps!” said Cis, and laughed. “You lead;
you know the country and I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Like to walk? Because I know a nice place,
but it’s fairly far, and taxis grow in this soil, if
you’ll have one,” suggested Moore.</p>

<p>“I’m a walker; I’ll risk the distance,” replied
Cis, and they started out.</p>

<p>Three miles from the Beacon Head they came
into a pretty glade, wooded, suggestive at a glance
of song birds and flowers. Here they seated themselves,
Cis on a bank, G. Rodney Moore just below
her. All the way there they had talked, Cis with
her customary frankness, till, on their arrival,
Moore had justly decided that she was exactly what
she seemed and announced herself to be; a single-minded,
honest girl, of extraordinary directness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and simplicity; lonely, wanting comradeship, not
hesitating to take it where she should find it, with
confidence that she would find understanding
where she found congeniality, and without the
smallest shade of coquetry, or of hidden purpose.</p>

<p>“Mighty odd, quite unique, but the gods were
good to me when they let her decide that I’d
answer for a stop-gap till she got acquainted in
Beaconhite. Never saw her equal! It will be my
own fault if I let her drift away from me, and I
won’t!” he told himself, listening to Cis’s merry
talk, watching her changing face, all gay laughter
and wholesome sweetness, its red hair framing it in
an aureole, wind-made.</p>

<p>Cis told Rodney all about herself; he told her
some things about himself. They were friends at
the end of the little excursion, “pals,” Cis liked to
call it, finding this “pal” more delightful than any
other she had known; clever, humorous, charming.
She did not hesitate to speak of this charm.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know anyone but a girl had your kind
of fun; boys don’t usually know how to play your
way,” Cis cried delightedly. “You’re lots of fun,
and you’re really as nice as you can be!”</p>

<p>“I’m not a boy, Cicely,” Rodney replied, a trifle
sadly—they were Cicely and Rodney by this time.
“I don’t suppose I played this way when I was a
boy, but I had the material in me and experience
cultivated it. Glad you like me, jolly Cicely.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. It was luck that made me find you
to-day; I knew luck was running my way when I
came to Beaconhite! Aren’t you a boy, quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
young, anyway? You haven’t told me that,” said
Cis.</p>

<p>“I’m thirty, shall be thirty-one next spring, and
that’s beyond boyhood. Why do you lay such
stress on boyhood, my dear? Neither it, nor girlhood
lasts,” he said.</p>

<p>“I shall be twenty-two on Christmas Day,” said
Cis slowly. “I don’t know why, but I belong with
boys; I don’t belong with grown men.”</p>

<p>“Only with this grown man. We’re friends, and
dates don’t alter it,” he said quickly. “Were you
born on Christmas Day? What a sell! Shame,
Pal-Cicely.”</p>

<p>“Shame? Why is it? I always liked it a lot;
nice day to be born on, seems to me,” cried Cis.
“The whole world glad on your birthday, and——”
she checked herself.</p>

<p>“Does you out of a separate <i>festa</i>, and additional
gifts,” said Rodney. “But your magnificent hair
would serve for Christmas decorations; I never saw
such hair, Cicely! I’m going to call you Holly; do
you mind?”</p>

<p>“Not I!” Cis laughed delightedly. “It isn’t that
kind of red, but it’s pretty flaring.”</p>

<p>“It is glorious; copper, gold and pure flame!
Wouldn’t Titian have had a fit over it! Holly, I
hate to say it, but if we’re to lunch, we’ve got to be
getting back to it,” suggested Rodney.</p>

<p>“I am hungry,” agreed Cis. “I’ve had a fine
morning; much obliged. You’ve no idea how
lonely I was beginning to feel, and the girls I tried
to creep up toward poked me off with icy finger tips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
wouldn’t stoop to use a whole palm! Are you
going to introduce me to some nice girls?”</p>

<p>“Want another pal already?” Rodney said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; you’re all-around satisfactory, but I do
want to know girls, too. Please let me know your
nicest friends,” begged Cis, laughing, but in earnest.</p>

<p>Rodney considered. Rapidly he passed in mental
review the girls whom he knew; society girls,
young matrons, some of other rank. None to
whom he could compare this dewy, sweet, merry,
daring, innocent Cicely, none with whom he could
think of her in combination.</p>

<p>“I’ll look some up, Cicely,” he said. “I had a
sister, but she has been gone these many years, and
would have been too old for you; older than I am.
We’re all right as we are for the time being, aren’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Happy as clams!” cried Cis. “Now if I get my
position, with a pal in town, and a place like that—how
about it?”</p>

<p>“Nifty!” cried Rodney. “Will you go to a show
with me to-night? I know of private theatricals
for a charity, and they won’t be half-bad. Will you
go, dear young pal of mine?” He sang the refrain
of the song, one word appropriately altered.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Dutch treat!” cried Cis, and as he was
about to expostulate, she added: “Or not at all.
If I’m to be a real pal, then I stand on my
own, just as real pals do and should. Dutch treat?
Say yes, and I’ll say yes, with pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Yes, then, but you’re a girl all right; girls insist
on their own way,” grumbled Rodney.</p>

<p>Cis laughed, and threw her hat into the air,
catching it deftly.</p>

<p>“Best of both parts, the girl’s and the boy’s,
that’s what this Cis Adair is out for, and independence
comes both ways,” she triumphed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

BEGINNING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COMING back into the lobby of the Beacon
Head, Cis darted ahead of Rodney Moore and
up to the clerk’s desk. Here in her particular
pigeonhole, held down by the key of her room with
its broad, portable mooring displaying the same
number as the pigeonhole, lay a letter, fallen
almost flat. Cis saw at once that the upper left corner
bore the name she sought: “Lucas and Henderson,”
in exceedingly clear-cut small Roman letters,
the firm address engraved below them.</p>

<p>“My key and mail, please,” said Cis, trying to
appear casual, in reality stirred by hope and fear.
Somehow she did not want to leave Beaconhite;
suddenly she found it desirable to stay on here, and
this letter might compel her to travel on, unless
she were able to stumble upon employment by
strangers, to whom she had no introduction.</p>

<p>Cis walked back to where Rodney Moore awaited
her beside a small leather-covered sofa, turning the
letter in her hands.</p>

<p>“My verdict has come in; my lawyers have notified
me,” she said, dropping on the brown seat, tipping
her head back against the sofa-back, unconscious
that the dark brown leather made a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
background for her copper-red hair. “Wonder if
it is that I’m to go farther?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! Too certain that you’d fare worse!”
declared Rodney promptly. “You’re not going an
inch out of Beaconhite, that’s flat! I can put you
into something; poor enough, but enough to hold
on by till you find what you want. Open up,
Cicely; read your offer of $10,000 a year!”</p>

<p>Cis “opened up,” slitting the end of the envelope
with the point of her bar pin, prolonging the operation
in a way unlike herself.</p>

<p>The communication which she unfolded was
brief, compactly typed in the middle of a large
page. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss Cicely Adair,<br>
The Beacon Head, Beaconhite.<br>
Dear Miss Adair:—</p>

<p>I am prepared to offer you a position in my personal
service, as my secretary. Your duties I vaguely
outlined to you when you called upon me. Your salary
would be, to begin, $42.00 per week, or $7.00 per day.
If you prove competent, still more, if you prove satisfactory
in the ways more important than mere skill, of
which I spoke to you, your salary will soon exceed this
sum. If this offer is acceptable to you, kindly report
for duty on Monday next, at my office, at nine-thirty
in the morning.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours truly,</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Wilmer Lucas</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>“Great little old snarled up signature!” commented
Rodney, whom Cicely had permitted to
read the letter with her. “Wouldn’t be easy to
forge! Not a bad salary, my Holly friend, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
increase will be swift, or else you won’t stay. Not
bad. We’ll have a supper after the private theatricals,
to celebrate; just we two!”</p>

<p>“Let me off from the theatricals, please, will you,
Rodney?” asked Cis. “I’ve been sorry I said I’d
go, anyway; it’ll be kind of a cross between a place
where you’ve a right to go, and a place where
you’re intruding. I know ’em; they’re always like
that! All the friends and relations of the performers
are there—like a funeral!—and they talk
across to one another, and look at a person as if
they wondered how on earth you broke in—selling
tickets for a charity doesn’t calm ’em. But what’s
more, I ought not to go anywhere to-night, except
to boarding houses. I’ve got to find a place to live,
if I’m going to stay in Beaconhite; can’t stand $5.00
a day at this hotel, wouldn’t leave much for—well,
for having my shoes polished, for instance!” She
stopped to enjoy her own allusion with the liquid
gurgle of laughter that did not pass her throat, for
which Rodney Moore had already learned to wait
with anticipation.</p>

<p>“But it is a nice salary to begin on, isn’t it? I
knew Friday was my lucky day! Found a jolly
pal who suits me fine, and got my job! Wonder if
Christmas fell on Friday the year I was born?”
Cis ended with another little suppressed laugh.</p>

<p>“What a girl! You don’t mind letting a chap
know that you think he’s all right, and are glad that
you found him, do you?” cried Rodney, puzzled
but admiring, somewhat piqued, nevertheless; such
frankness was prohibitive as well as welcoming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Don’t mind anything that’s honest! Besides,
pals don’t flirt. You didn’t say whether you’d let
me off from the movies—I mean the theatricals?”
Cis said.</p>

<p>“What else can I do?” retorted Rodney. “If you
don’t want to go, I’m not going to force it. But as
to boarding places, what’s the matter with coming
where I am? Funny old girl keeps it, but her
heart’s so big she has to cover it up. She sets a
great table, and neat’s no word for her! You could
be as happy with one of her old-fashioned dinners
served on the floor as on the table, and her
kitchen’s shining clean! You’ll never find another
place as good. I’ll speak to Miss Gallatin, and engage
the place for you; I know there’s a room
empty now, though it doesn’t often happen.”</p>

<p>“Good boy, Rodney Moore!” Cis approved him.
“Then I won’t go hunting board, but I don’t want
to go to the theatricals. I’ll write Nan and Miss
Lucas.”</p>

<p>“You’re not bidding me run away and play by
myself this first evening, are you?” Rodney made
a great show of consternation, but watched Cis.</p>

<p>“Not if you want to play with me,” Cis told him.
“But how about those theatricals? Thought you
were booked for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother the theatricals! I’ve bought two
tickets and that’s all I’m obliged to do about them,”
declared Rodney. “I’d rather play with you;
you’re a discovery, Miss Cicely Adair.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered the handsome girl who was
playing the leading part in the theatricals that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
night, the girl who had social position, wealth and
glorious beauty, though not charm, nor more than
a somewhat minus allowance of brains, but in regard
to whom G. Rodney Moore had definite plans.
He was surprised to find that he had forgotten Gertrude
Davenport till Cis indirectly reminded him
of her; remembering her now, her beauty did not
seem so glorious as usual as his eyes rested on the
varied expression of Cis’s face. There was no
denying that this new girl had charm and to spare.</p>

<p>“A discovery? Well, if it comes to that, I’m not
as sure as I’d like to be that I’m the discovery; I
suspect that I discovered you. Come around, if
you want to, and tell me what your Miss Gallagher
says about taking me to board; get her terms, and
the whole thing. But if you change your mind
about the theatricals, it’s perfectly all right. Call
me up, though, please, because if I’m not going to
your boarding house I’ve got to hunt up another,
start out early in the morning. I’ll look for you
at half past eight or so, but I’ll not mind a speck
if you go to your private theatricals. So don’t feel
tied up.” Cis spoke with crisp cheerfulness, having
risen and begun moving toward the stairs, her
eyes on the clock behind the desk.</p>

<p>“H’m! Pleasant to be told you’re as welcome to
be absent as to be present, that you don’t matter a
whoop!” grumbled Rodney, and meant it. “I’ll
be around, Miss Cicely, and don’t you forget it!
I’d come, if it was only to begin your lessons in
finding me necessary! Congratulations are in
order, by the way; I forgot to offer them. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
landed a big fish when you landed the private secretaryship
to Wilmer Lucas! We’ll celebrate—when?
To-morrow? Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Not to-morrow; I’ve got to get settled living
somewhere, permanently,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Sunday, then? Do you lie late Sunday? Any
objections to a pleasant time on that day? I don’t
suspect you of Puritanism! I myself get up about
noon on Sunday, but I’m ready to forego my
needed rest and trot you out in the forenoon. If
not, we’ll lunch somewhere, and go for a jolly time
afterward,” suggested Rodney.</p>

<p>“Time enough to talk about Sunday,” returned
Cis. “I usually get up fairly early; Sunday, too,
but I don’t spend the day psalm reading. Run
along; I’m busy. Let me know about Miss Gallagher
by telephone, or otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise; at eight-thirty sharp. By the way,
it’s Gallatin, not Gallagher. Good-bye, Holly.
You’re a peach, and I’m glad we had our shoes
polished!” cried Rodney.</p>

<p>Cis laughed, and ran up the stairs, scorning the
elevator. At the landing she caught a glimpse of
Rodney standing where she had left him, watching
her. She started to turn back to wave him a supplementary
farewell, but checked herself, and went
on without betraying that she knew he was still
there. She finished her journey up the second section
of the stairway, wondering at herself. Never
before in all her life had she refused herself the
expression of a friendly impulse. Was it shyness?
Could it be coquetry that had held her hand from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that last salute? She had never been shy; she
scorned coquetry. “Air of Beaconhite doesn’t
agree with you, Cis, my dear old chap!” she warned
herself.</p>

<p>Miss Hannah Gallatin was a character, as Rodney
had implied. She was tall and gaunt, almost
stern in manner, curt of word, severe, but there was
no kinder creature in the world than this lonely
maiden woman who had no one of kith nor kin on
whom to lavish love, who therefore, perhaps, had
taught herself not to express it except by ceaseless
deeds of kindness, done as if they were penal.</p>

<p>She was a convert to the Catholic Church, one
that would not have been predicted, but Father
Morley, of St. Francis’ church, himself the son of
a convert to the Old Faith, had many converts to
his credit; among them Hannah Gallatin, who, if
she did not grace it in one sense, certainly was an
honor to it in all essential senses.</p>

<p>To this fine, though eccentric person G. Rodney
Moore repaired upon his return from the Beacon
Head. In the course of his walk, meditating upon
Cicely Adair, he had warmed into a great admiration
for her wit, her charm, her kindliness, her unmistakable
purity of thought and deed below her
boyish daring, which might easily be misunderstood.
Therefore the enthusiasm he felt for Cis
escaped into his eyes and voice as he laid before
Miss Gallatin the need that “a friend of his” had
of a good home, a comfortable room, nice surroundings,
“not the ordinary boarding house,” he
added, feeling himself diplomatically clever. “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Miss Adair,” he went on to say, “is precisely the
kind of girl whom Miss Gallatin would like about;
he felt proud to be the one to offer such a perfect
fit, from both points of view, for Miss Gallatin’s
cozy room, now vacant.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Miss Gallatin, regarding Rodney attentively.
She did not wholly like this one of her
boarders, though she knew no justification of her
distrust. He had come to her, a stranger in the
city; had been regular in his goings and comings;
orderly in the house; agreeable to his fellow-guests;
he never went to church, but Miss Gallatin
knew that in the present generation of Protestants
this proved nothing worse than that they had let
go of the illogical anchorage of their fathers; she
did not know that G. Rodney’s last name had been
drawn from that green sod wherein church-going
was a totally different matter. If she had known
that this Moore had been an Irish name in the time
of its present possessor’s great-grandfather, she
would have exclaimed: “There!” triumphantly,
but she had no suspicion that Rodney Moore had
been brought up to go to Mass. “He did not show
it,” as she might have said. “Oh!” Miss Gallatin
now exclaimed, adding at once: “Ah! Friend of
yours, you say? Schoolmate? How long’ve you
known her? Live in Beaconhite?”</p>

<p>“She is going to live here,” said Rodney, flushing,
annoyed, trying to hide it in order not to
frustrate his own ends. “She has just come here,
five days ago. She is to be Wilmer Lucas’ secretary;
his brother sent her to him, and she’s not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
sort of girl to chum in with all sorts. She’s an
awfully nice girl, Miss Gallatin; just your kind!”</p>

<p>“Like me?” hinted Miss Gallatin. “Character or
looks? About my complexion and figure, I’ll bet
a dollar! Can’t be quite my age. How long did
you say you’d known her?”</p>

<p>“Not long,” said Rodney. “But I know her well;
she’s that frank sort that hasn’t a thing to hide;
fearless, straight, boyish, but not tom-boyish—get
the idea? I’m perfectly sure you’ll like her beyond
anything. I’ll bring her around this evening; she’s
at the Head. You can let her see the room, arrange
terms, give her a look over with your eagle eye—and
the thing’s done! I’d like her in the house, of
course; she’s the kind of girl that is like a nice
sister, chummy, helpful, if you get me? But for
her own sake I want her here, where you’ll give her
just what she needs in every way. I’ll bring her
around; I told her I’d see her after dinner to-night.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” declared Miss
Gallatin. “You told me you had tickets for the
theatricals. Isn’t Gertrude Davenport in ’em?
Forgotten all about it? Met this new girl for the
first time to-day, I’ll wager! She must be something
of a cyclone! You needn’t bring her around,
Mr. G. Rodney Moore; I’m not going to let my
vacant room to her, whether all you say of her is
true, or whether it isn’t!”</p>

<p>“You’re not willing so much as to show it to her?
To meet her? Strange way to act, Miss Gallatin!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
I am justified in resenting it,” said Rodney with
dignity.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort!” cried Miss Gallatin
briskly. “Don’t have theatricals here; better go to
them. She may be a nice girl, but the nicer she is
the more reason for keeping her out of the same
house where the young man boards whom she got
acquainted with, dear knows how! I wouldn’t consider
taking her, not if every room but yours was
vacant! So that’s settled.”</p>

<p>“She is a fine girl, I tell you! She’s not exactly
pretty, but she has the sort of face you like to
watch, and her hair is a wonder; loads of bright
coppery red hair, and she is full of jolly, kiddish
fun, straight and good. I respect her like everything.
Good gracious, Miss Gallatin, I’m over
thirty; do you suppose I don’t know a nice girl when
I see one and talk to her unreservedly? I respect
Miss Adair as much as I admire her!” cried Rodney,
surprised later on to find how much he cared
about the defence of Cicely.</p>

<p>“Right! Keep on respecting her,” said Miss
Gallatin. “Send her to Mrs. Wallace’s; she keeps
a good house, sets a good table, good’s mine. I
won’t have her here. Hold on a minute, Mr.
Moore! Send her around to talk with me to-morrow,
sometime. I won’t let her board here, but
I’ll take her to see Mrs. Wallace. If she can’t come
to-morrow, send her Sunday. Don’t you take her
to Mrs. Wallace’s; I will. She’s a stranger here,
going to work for Mr. Lucas where she’ll be noticed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Don’t start her wrong by escorting her to look
up her boarding place. People are queer things;
they’re more than likely to hope for the worst.
Send the girl to me. I won’t take her in here, but
I’ll do by her as I’d want done by me, if I was a
young Hannah Gallatin, setting out to earn my
living in a strange place. From what you say of
her, she’s a conspicuous sort of girl that people with
keen palates for gossip will be likely to lick to get
a flavor of delicious suspicion! That’s the best I
can do and say, so take yourself off, Mr. Moore, if
you please; I’ve got my weekly accounts to make
up, and it’s always a trial to my eyes, and my
nerves, also my temper—of course, after the other
two!”</p>

<p>There was nothing for Rodney to do but to accept
defeat with as much grace as he could summon.
There was consolation in the thought that
Miss Gallatin was willing to see Cicely, though
only to conduct her to a rival house. He hoped
that seeing her, Miss Gallatin might yield her position;
he felt entire confidence in Cicely’s ability to
win anyone’s complete trust and liking. There was
no denying that Miss Gallatin was a wise and kind
dragon in her guardianship of this girl whom she
had never seen.</p>

<p>Sunday morning Cicely betook herself to Mass
at eight o’clock, keeping up her old hour, reflecting
with a sense of bewilderment that only the previous
Sunday she had heard Mass in the only church
which, up to this time, she had ever known, and
that Nan was with her, and that she had returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
with her into the familiar Dowling household,
where young Tom gloomed over their near parting
and Mrs. Dowling lectured her on probable dangers
which clearly implied her own deficiencies. And
now she was beginning life in Beaconhite, uprooted,
yet already replanted, on a larger salary,
in promising conditions. She had a new friend
with whom she was to do something new and pleasant
that afternoon. She was a lucky Cis, she
thought, kneeling, without much concentration
upon it, before the altar, well in the front of the
church of St. Francis Xavier at the eight o’clock
Mass.</p>

<p>The priest who said this Mass was not young; he
was remarkably tall, his shoulders contracted from
the reading habit; his hair grey; his eyes deep-set
and glowing with singular light; his nose large and
handsome; his mouth finely cut, somewhat sad, yet
ready to smile, as Cis found out when he turned to
his people and began to speak after the reading of
the Gospel. A remarkable man, whom Cis began
to watch intently, feeling at once attracted and repulsed
by him, as if she sensed in him the implanted
power of the Holy Ghost which all who
knew Father Morley said was his gift, the power
that reads souls and irresistibly draws them.</p>

<p>Once Cis was sure that the priest’s eyes met her
own, full and steadily; that he knew her for a
stranger, and measured her. She liked him, yet she
feared him; coming out of the church slowly, borne
by the pressure of the immense throng into the
outer air, she was conscious of relief, and was glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
that it “was not her way to know the priest; that
one was——”</p>

<p>Someone touched her arm, a tall, thin, stern
looking woman, with clear, kindly eyes, at whom
Cis looked questioningly, her formulation of Father
Morley suspended. “Are you Miss Adair, I
wonder?” asked the woman.</p>

<p>“Yes; Cicely Adair,” replied Cis.</p>

<p>“I saw you were a stranger. Taking your hair,
and all together, I thought you must be the girl Mr.
Moore talked to me about taking. I’m Miss Gallatin,
Hannah Gallatin. Come home with me; I’m
going to get you a good boarding place, but not in
my house. Fasting?” said Miss Gallatin, speaking
with a sort of crisp rapidity.</p>

<p>“No; I had breakfast at the hotel as soon as the
doors were opened,” said Cis. “Mr. Moore said you
didn’t want me, because he knew me, or words to
that effect.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I, though I see he judged you right;
G. Rodney always struck me as a man who could
judge a woman accurately,” said Miss Gallatin.
“Didn’t suppose you’d turn out to be a Catholic.
Convert, like myself?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Cis. “I was born one; I’m several
kinds of races, all Catholic, except my mother, and
she had English blood; half of her blood was English
Protestant. But none of my people came from
their old countries lately; they were all great or
still greater grandparents who came over here, so
I’m quite thoroughly American, as things go.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Goodness, I don’t care a rap about such things!
I’m here, Cis Adair, and what do I care!”</p>

<p>“Verse?” asked Miss Gallatin.</p>

<p>“No; worse! Just a fluke; it does rhyme, doesn’t
it?” laughed Cis. “Rod said you wanted to steer
me to a house you knew about, though you
wouldn’t have me in yours. Kind of you, Miss
Gallatin—at least half of it is!”</p>

<p>“It surely is, and it’s the half you don’t mean!”
agreed Miss Gallatin. “I’ve had no breakfast.
Come with me, and after I’ve seen to my household,
and eaten, I’ll take you to Mrs. Wallace. Mr.
Moore never gets up till noon, Sundays; you won’t
see him. You call him Rod; known him long?”</p>

<p>“Mercy yes! Forty-eight hours!” Cis’s laugh
rang out. “You see, Miss Gallatin, I’ve been out in
the world, earning my living since I was old enough
to earn it, and that was early, because I was always
quick to learn, and I was about twenty when I was
fourteen. I’ve always had boy friends, and I’m not
a bit afraid to chum with them. I’ve some good
girl friends, chiefly one, but it’s the nice boy who
always takes you as you want to be taken. So when
I met Rod Moore we fell right together; I was getting
green-lonely, and I’m pleased as pleasure to
have him like me and see me on my way.”</p>

<p>“I see!” Miss Gallatin evidently did see, yet Cis
felt that her agreement was noncommittal, involving
something that she did not understand. “I
like you, too, Cis—did you say Cis?—Adair, and I
hope you’ll let me help you out, if ever Beaconhite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
gets too tight for you; presses on any sore
spot.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t one!” cried Cis. “Thanks, Miss Gallatin;
I like you, and I didn’t like you one bit till I
saw you! I suppose it’s all right of you to shove
me off, but it isn’t sensible, either; I could board
in the house with all my boy chums, be the only
girl in the offing, and it would go as smooth as silk.”</p>

<p>“You may have knocked about the world, as you
say you have, Cis Adair, and you may have been
twenty at fourteen, but at twenty-two—I’d guess?—you
are four in some ways, and your experience
is by no means rounded out,” said Miss Gallatin
oracularly. “Prudence is one of the gifts of the
Holy Ghost, my dear, as your catechism taught you,
and it’s one of His most valuable gifts to attractive
young women, left alone in the world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember much catechism, Miss Gallatin,”
said honest Cis, with her happy laugh. “I
learned some of it when I was confirmed, but I’m
not much of a Catholic. Of course I’d never be a
Protestant,” she added hastily, “but my religion
doesn’t bother me much.”</p>

<p>“No; it wasn’t founded for that purpose,” returned
Miss Gallatin. “I wonder how you will be
taught to value it? You’ve got to learn, of course
you know that.”</p>

<p>Cis looked at her startled, and she was silent for
a moment in which her mind went out toward an
invisible, infinite track, down which sorrow and
suffering, vague, threatening, nameless, molding
events, were advancing upon her. Cicely Adair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
fearless, free, strong, independent, would be tamed,
bound, caught, crushed, perhaps; signed by the
cross, and thus learn its meaning.</p>

<p>Cicely shook off the fear that gripped her, the
first fear that in all her life had ever assaulted her
deep in her heart. Why had it thus assailed her?
What had made her vulnerable to a shaft from the
hand of this gaunt woman, past middle age, whose
effects were almost grotesque? Cis threw back her
radiant head with a short, unmirthful laugh.</p>

<p>“Did they name you Hannah because you were
going to be a prophetess, Miss Gallatin?” she asked.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

CODES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CICELY had been three weeks in the service of
Mr. Wilmer Lucas, four weeks a resident of
Beaconhite. Although it lacked three days of
being a calendar month the time seemed to her to
stretch indefinitely backward into such length, that
she had to stop to reckon up how long it actually
had been. New experiences were crowding upon
her, filling each day with interests so absorbing that
the hours sped by, yet left a residue of the effect of
more than twice their duration. Cicely was conscious
of changes wrought upon herself by these
swiftly passing days, changes so far undefined, yet
not the less perceptible.</p>

<p>For one thing, her new friendship was proving
interesting as none other had ever before interested
her. Cicely had had many friends among the boys,
and, later, among the young men of her acquaintance,
but though they had been “jolly good fun,”
as she put it, they were not especially interesting.
She was easily the dominant one in every case; the
chief interest afforded her by these youths was
when they temporarily spoiled her theory of perfect
comradeship between the sexes, which was
devoid of sentiment, by falling in love with her,
but this, although it interested her, displeased her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
She invariably swung back into her faith in the
possibility of a chum of the opposite sex, but it was
annoying to find it so often a theory that failed only
in its workings.</p>

<p>In G. Rodney Moore, Cicely had a friend of a
totally new sort. He was older than she was, for
one thing; he had seen immensely more of the
world than she had, for another; he had read more
than she had, let alone than any of her previous
male friends. Most of all, he had an easy certainty
of himself; an amused toleration of her insufficiently
grounded opinions; a ready wit; great
charm of face, voice and manner, so that, for the
first time, Cicely found herself by no means able to
hold the ascendency over him with which she had
set out dealing with him, which had always, heretofore,
been hers in dealing with young men. And,
being essentially feminine beneath her boyish
ways, she liked the man who dominated, while he
admired her. There was much of the excitement
of exploration for her in advancing constantly farther
into friendship with this man.</p>

<p>Her work was also opening out new vistas to
Cicely, daily demanding from her hitherto dormant
capacity, skill of hand, but far more quickness of
brain, judgment, discretion, all-around intelligence.
It was transforming her day by day; although
she did not definitely recognize this, yet its
effect upon her was to increase the bewilderment
of mind with which she was adjusting to new conditions,
and to what was to prove the greatest
experience of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Cicely had been well educated with reference to
practical ends; she and Nan had been superior to
the majority of the girls amid whom they were
employed; their position in the telephone exchange
had been honorable, but not dignified. Now Cicely
found herself surrounded by the portentous dignity
of the private office of a lawyer who was, at
the same time, a bank president, <i>the</i> great man of
the city.</p>

<p>Solid men, both physically and financially solid,
came to consult Mr. Lucas; Cis was gravely saluted
by them as they entered and departed; she heard
matters discussed which her keen wits soon showed
her were of gravest importance in the money market,
even in national affairs. All her former days
had been lighted by nonsense for which she found
opportunity among her companions; fun and nonsense
were as the breath of life to Cicely Adair.
Now from nine till four there was not only a complete
dearth of opportunity to play, but the mere
thought of trifling within those solemn, mahogany
wainscoted walls, intruded like a profanation.</p>

<p>Cis was expected to be well-dressed, perfectly
groomed—but this was natural to her. She was
expected to take down any sort of dictation correctly,
even to the dictation that she be elegantly
correct in manner, reserved, silent, yet devoted,
and this dictation was never given her directly but
by the assumption that she was all these things.
“I’m getting turned into a regular heavy damask,
ten dollars a square inch,” she told Rodney.</p>

<p>It was true that this outward pressure inevitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
had an inward effect upon the girl, yet nothing
could ever quite subdue her native sense of humor,
her frank friendliness to all the world.</p>

<p>“Miss Adair,” said Mr. Lucas one morning, “I
have waited till we were mutually assured of your
permanence in this office before initiating you into
one of its secrets. You are quite sure that you
desire to remain with me?”</p>

<p>“If I suit you, Mr. Lucas,” answered Cis. “I’m
happy here, but I’m not sure how I’m coming on.”</p>

<p>“Satisfactorily, Miss Adair. On my part there
is no question of severing the connection. Are you
settled upon continuing?” Mr. Lucas looked at
Cicely kindly, and she blushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Lucas,” she said. “I’m settled upon
settling.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” her employer smiled. “Then I am going
to ask you to learn the office code.”</p>

<p>“Code?” repeated Cis.</p>

<p>“We are often involved in cases which would be
disastrous to great interests if they were known to
the public. The mails are safe enough, and yet,
like all human arrangements, they may sometimes
miscarry. Mr. Henderson; our senior clerk, Mr.
Saunders; our office in Chicago, and Washington,
and myself use a code in relation to these affairs
known only to the principals in our Chicago and
Washington offices, and the three persons in this
office whom I have mentioned. We have decided to
have you learn the code, to use it when occasion
arises in correspondence with our other two offices.
Will you learn this code, Miss Adair, and are you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
willing to give your solemn pledge that under no
circumstances, to no human being, will you ever
disclose it?” Mr. Lucas explained, and waited for
Cicely’s reply.</p>

<p>She looked at him with widening eyes, her brilliant
eyes, dark, of a color that was hard to determine,
varying with her mood and as the light struck
into them.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a dandy detective story!” Cis said
involuntarily. “Yes, I’ll learn the code, provided
I can learn it, and of course I’ll never teach it to
anyone else. How do I learn it?”</p>

<p>“It is set down in a sort of chart; you will study
it here, of course; the chart must not go out of the
office. There is an alphabet connected with it; I
am afraid that you will find it troublesome, but I
should like you to master it. By the way, my
brother has become a Roman Catholic; his family
is brought up in that religion; do you happen to be
a Romanist?” Mr. Lucas frowned slightly as he
asked the question.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Lucas; I’m a Catholic,” said Cis.
“Why, please?”</p>

<p>“Always running to confession? Asking advice
of the priest on every known and unknown point,
I suppose! What about the code and its secrecy?”
said Mr. Lucas.</p>

<p>Cis laughed outright. “Never asked a priest’s
advice on anything in all my life; don’t go to confession
more than twice a year. I don’t know what
you mean about the code, Mr. Lucas,” she said.</p>

<p>“You Romanists are a difficult lot to adjust to,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
said Mr. Lucas. “I strongly object to the principle
which is fundamental with you, of laying down
your liberty of thought, being subject to a man,
taking your opinions from an elevated priest over
in Rome and acting on them at the dictation of a
lot of half-educated common priests over here.
Yet when you don’t keep up with the practices of
your Church, you are a worthless lot, not often
trustworthy. I make an exception of you, Miss
Adair; I am satisfied that you are trustworthy,
though, apparently, you are what I’ve heard your
co-religionists call ‘an indifferent Catholic.’ Perhaps
you are on your way out of Romanism? It
would be a consummation devoutly to be wished.
As to the code and its secrecy, what I meant is this:
Suppose a priest wanted to get hold of it—they are
great people for dipping their oar into other
people’s waters and muddying them! Suppose a
matter concerning politics, or the like, were afoot,
and a priest heard of our code, in which we should
correspond on such affairs—they are great people
for finding out things that no one could ever have
imagined their knowing! Suppose this priest, as
I was saying, heard of our code and bade you in
the confessional reveal it to him, what would you
do?”</p>

<p>Again Cis laughed, this time with such heartiness,
such manifest enjoyment of an absurdity that
Mr. Lucas was already answered by her mirth.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Lucas,” cried Cis, “you don’t know
how funny that is, really you don’t! I go to confession
at Easter, usually at Christmas; it’s my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
birthday, too. And there’s a regular mob; it’s all
the priests can do to get them all heard. Imagine
one of them holding up the line while he talked
code to me! How would he know I was in your
office, anyway? I wouldn’t have to confess that;
you only have to confess sins, and it’s not a sin to
be employed here, Mr. Lucas! Why the poor
priests try to get in a word of advice to you, and
tell you what your penance is, but they can’t always
do much more than say about ten words to you!
No fear of the code getting talked over! Honest,
Mr. Lucas, that’s <i>funny</i>!”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas looked as though he were not sure that
this was not impertinence on Cis’s part, but he decided
to accept it for what it actually was, bubbling
amusement over a mistake that struck her as absurd.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve certainly never confessed,” he admitted,
“nor ever shall, but I still think, though my
supposition is outside your experience so far, that
the case is entirely possible. What I want to know
is what you would do if such a demand arose?”</p>

<p>“Hold my tongue, of course; what else could I
do?” replied Cis with convincing promptitude.
“He’d have no right to try to get it out of me, and
I’d have no right to tell him.”</p>

<p>The code was put into Cicely’s hands the next
day, her duties so arranged that she should have
time for its study. To her chagrin she found it
difficult, although her difficulty was usually in
learning too fast to be secure of retention, rather
than in acquiring her tasks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>The third day of work on the code left her still
uncertain of it when she quitted the office at four
o’clock to go with Rodney Moore on a part aquatic,
part walking expedition up the river in his boat,
out through a lovely wooded country to a knowing
little restaurant whither Beaconhite people loved
to repair to dine. A letter from Nan had come to
add to Cis’s depression; she set forth with a marked
diminution of her usual blitheness, although this
expedition with Rodney, in the height of the foliage
season in October, had been anticipated by her for
two weeks. When Rodney met her at Mrs. Wallace’s
he instantly marked the shadow on Cis’s
face; he was quick to note every change in that
variable face which was rapidly becoming the goal
of his feet, the image hourly before his memory.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong, Holly-Berry? You haven’t so
much of your usual effect of Christmas-all-the-year-around!
I thought of that last night, Cis, that
you were a sort of perpetual Merry Christmas;
your joyousness was probably a birthday gift to
you,” Rodney said, pulling her hand through his
arm with unmistakable satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That’s nice, Rod!” Cis cried. “I’d like to be
a Merry Christmas sort of thing. No, there’s nothing
wrong. I’ll tell you when we get to the place
where you’re taking me, or while we’re rowing.”</p>

<p>“Tell me exactly how there’s nothing wrong,
Holly? I knew your lights were slightly dimmed.
How you show your feelings!” Rod laughed with
satisfaction in this proof of their intimacy, that he
could instantly discern Cicely’s moods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Caught me that time! But it’s nothing, truly.
That old code bothers me; never tackled anything
else that wouldn’t stay by me over night! The
alphabet is ridiculous; little scriggles going one
way, crossed by little scriggles going the other way—and
they’d all look exactly as well, or as crazy!—reversed!
I get to wondering why they don’t go
the other way about, and then I can’t remember
which way they <i>do</i> go! But of course I’ll get them
fastened down soon; it’s not worth bothering over,
Rory, my pal.” Cis beamed on Rodney, liking his
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Rory?” queried Rodney.</p>

<p>“Sure-ly! Rory O’Moore, don’t you know?
That’s really your name; it came to me this morning
while I was getting ready to go out!” Cis
laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, by jiminy, Cis, I don’t care what you call
me if you’ll think of me so frequently. It means
I’m getting on the inside!” Rodney’s delight was
unmistakable. “Are you Kathleen bawn?”</p>

<p>Cis shook her head. “Why?” she asked, then
blushed fiercely as the words of the old song came
to her: “Rory O’Moore courted Kathleen bawn.”</p>

<p>Before she was called upon to speak, just as
Rodney murmured:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rory O’Moore courted Kathleen bawn:</div>
<div class="verse">He was bold as the day, she as fair as the morn,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>an extraordinarily handsome girl, sumptuously
dressed, beyond the strict propriety of a walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
costume, swung around the corner which they were
about to cross and almost ran into Cicely and
Rodney.</p>

<p>“Why, Gertrude—Miss Davenport!” exclaimed
Rodney.</p>

<p>“Oh, good evening, Mr. Moore; I beg your pardon.”
The handsome girl’s glance swept Cis from
head to foot. “Glad I wore my pongee,” thought
Cis, reflecting with satisfaction on the lines of her
tailor-made skirt and gown, its fine linen collar and
cuffs with their exquisite hand-wrought scallop and
corners.</p>

<p>“Awfully glad to meet you, Miss Davenport,”
Rodney continued. “I’ve wanted you to meet Miss
Adair. Please waive convention, and let a man
give you two girls a street introduction. Miss
Davenport, this is Miss Cicely Adair, a recent and
great acquisition to Beaconhite. Cicely, this is our
city’s pride, which is not at all the same thing as
civic pride.”</p>

<p>Rodney knew that he was speaking nervously,
and that his would-be cleverness halted at its intention.</p>

<p>Gertrude Davenport nodded, a crisp nod, her
head held sidewise, an amused smile on her lips.</p>

<p>“Delighted to waive ceremony, of course. Hope
you like Beaconhite, Miss Dare. We may meet
again; hope so. I’m not going your way, and am
in a hurry. Good evening, Mr. Moore, I began to
think you were no more; glad to see you are still
in town, alive, you know. I’ve been awfully occupied
lately, but I’ll receive you if you wish to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to the house where you heretofore spent practically
<i>all</i> your time; dad’s rather grateful for one less
to disturb him! He says he’s glad he has only
<i>one</i> daughter!” Gertrude Davenport laughed, but
her large, full eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t hope to have two like Gertrude;
his other one, if she’d been born, would have had
to wait till Gertrude was out of the way to be visible.
Thanks, Miss Davenport; I’ve been waiting
my chance, but I’ll get it soon, and you’ll see me
disturbing the pater!” Rodney assured her, with
an unfortunate note of condolence in his voice.</p>

<p>“Thanks; so good of you! Good-bye!” Again
Gertrude nodded crisply, sidewise, without more
notice of Cis than another swift, comprehensive
glance. Then she went rapidly on in her original
direction.</p>

<p>Rodney laughed and tucked Cis’s hand into his
arm. He had been weighing in his mind the overwhelming
attraction which Cis possessed for him,
against the great advantages which a marriage with
Gertrude Davenport included: Wealth, social position,
solid business connections, through her
father; not least a wife so handsome that wherever
he appeared with her all the other men would turn
to look at her, envying him. But now that Gertrude,
in all her splendor of face and form and
raiment had suddenly appeared beside Cis, Cis’s
irregular, winsome face, her merry kindliness, her
clear-eyed purity of heart, mind and purpose so
overtopped all Gertrude’s advantages, that he knew
at once that there could be no more debate in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
mind as to which girl he wanted to marry. Debate!
Why, what was gold beside Cicely’s copper hair?
What social position beside such a comrade? What
regular beauty beside Cis’s charm? As to money,
he could earn all that he needed. Rodney knew
that his mind was made up for him by the gravity
weight of Cicely Adair, drawing him; to do him
justice he was suddenly glowing with an unworldly
and genuine love for the girl, resolved to win her
with such desire that there was no question of sacrifice
for that end.</p>

<p>“Miss Davenport doesn’t like red hair, perhaps?”
hinted Cis demurely.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, Holly. Perhaps she likes to do
her own liking, solo. But if you ask me, I don’t
think it matters to the value of one of those red
hairs, what Miss Davenport doesn’t like, nor—which
is far more important—what she does like,”
Rodney said.</p>

<p>Cis raised her eyebrows; she had not missed
symptoms, and she was accurate in their diagnosis.</p>

<p>“It’s a world of changes, Rory O’Moore,” she
said. “A wise girl accepts them, and, if she’s still
wiser, she looks for the next change.”</p>

<p>“You young sinner! Do you mean—”</p>

<p>“Sinners aren’t prophets, Rod; never mind what
I mean,” Cis interrupted him.</p>

<p>Rodney pressed her hand in the crook of his
elbow; they both laughed and went on their way
rejoicing, Rodney exuberantly light-hearted, as if
he had just fallen into a fortune, or had escaped
a threatening danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Arrived at their ultimate destination, after a
pleasant row up the river, Rodney inducted Cicely
to the pretty glade of which he had told her, and
placed her comfortably upon a low knoll. The
blaze of autumn-tinted maples, oaks and sumacs
was all around them, so beautiful that Cis caught
her breath, then laughed to cover the emotion
which dimmed her eyes.</p>

<p>“I wonder how it can be so much more beautiful
than we can take in!” she said. “It gives me
no chance at all, though; makes even my hair look
drab!”</p>

<p>“Drab! I’d say so!” agreed Rodney derisively.
“Cis-Holly, how about that code? I’ll help you
with it, if you like; I’m a bird at things of that
sort.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done, Rod! I’m under the solemnest,
swearingest vow to keep that to myself. I’ll master
it by to-morrow; I’m sure it will jump into my
brain suddenly when it gets ready,” Cis answered,
thanking him with a smile.</p>

<p>“Something else is shading you,” Rodney reminded
her. “Said you’d tell me here.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to shade me, really; I ought to be
glad: it’s Nan,” Cis said slowly.</p>

<p>“Nan? Anything wrong with her?” Rodney
asked; he knew Nan by repute.</p>

<p>“No. But there is a youth, quite a nice youth,
who has been tagging on after her for some time,
and I’ve noticed that he was overhauling her, creeping
right up on her. And she has written me
that he has asked her to marry him, and she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
told him that she would give him his answer in
a week; she wants me to tell her which answer to
give,” Cis spoke disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Must be a great girl if she has to ask another
girl whether she wants to marry a man or not!”
exclaimed Rodney. “He’d be tickled pink if he
knew it, probably! What shall you bid her say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that, she knows what she is going to
say; that’s only a natural balking, natural to Nan,
anyway!” Cis smiled. “I’ll tell her to say yes.
She’s fond of him, and he truly is all right; ever
so much better than most fellows.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about ‘most fellows,’ Holly?
Then, if it’s all right, why do you look downcast
over it?” Rodney naturally inquired.</p>

<p>“Silliness,” responded Cis promptly. “But I’m
fond of Nannie; no girl likes to see her best friend
marry. It isn’t grudging her happiness, it’s, it’s,—I
don’t know what it is, but it hurts.”</p>

<p>“Well, heaven knows, marriage is a bad thing to
go into in half the cases, and at least half of the
other half are dragging, defeating, miserable endurance.
It isn’t the girl that needs all the pity and
anxiety; believe me, marriage is rough on a man,
too. The only comfort is that it’s easy enough to
slough it off; you can usually get a divorce, luckily!”
Rodney spoke so bitterly that Cis stared at
him.</p>

<p>“Is marriage so awful?” she asked. “It isn’t
because I ever thought that it was such a fearful
risk, that I’m sorry about Nan; it separates us more
than my coming to Beaconhite does. But divorce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
is horrible, at least Nan would never think of it;
she’s a devout Catholic, and so is Joe Hamilton,
whom she’ll marry. Have you known marriages
that turned out so bad as you say?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” Rodney’s brevity made his answer
more emphatic, and Cis wondered at the grim look
upon his face. “Poor Rod, it must have been his
mother! I’ve thought that he didn’t want to talk
of her,” she told herself. Then, to banish that
grimness, she jumped up and cried: “Let’s explore
a little, Rod; then we must start back; already it
gets dark early, and I’m going to be hungry in six
and a half minutes, precisely!”</p>

<p>“You can’t have anything to eat for fifteen minutes!”
Rodney laughed, throwing off seriousness
and triumphing in Cis’s surprise that food were
within a quarter of an hour’s accessibility. “Did
you observe that camera, as you thought it, that
black case? It holds a light supper, my ruddy
Holly, to preserve your life till a solid one is to
be had. Now tell me I’m careless of your comfort,
am mean, and not a good provider!”</p>

<p>“Never shall I tell you that, Rory O’Moore! I
never knew anyone so thoughtful. It’s fun to take
a snack out here, but, please, I don’t want to stay
late, Rod!” Cis said.</p>

<p>“Will you go out on Sunday for the whole day?
Start early? I’ll get up at half past six; we’ll be
off before eight—and I can’t give a stronger proof
of how I rate the privilege of a day with you in
the autumn glories!” Rodney smiled, yet meant it.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t start before—let’s see! Eight, nine—about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
quarter to ten, Rod. I’d love to go,
though,” Cis answered.</p>

<p>“Too late; the train we’d take leaves at 8:20.
Why can’t you get off as early as I can? You rise
early Sundays, you told me; I don’t.” Rodney
looked vexed.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Mass,” said Cis. “I always go at
eight; it’s the first one.”</p>

<p>“Mass!” Rodney fairly shouted the word. “Good
heavens, <i>Mass</i>! I never once suspected you of that!
Are you a holy Roman?”</p>

<p>“Not holy; just a Roman,” Cis corrected him.
“Neither did I suspect you of prejudices, of minding
what I was. I used to miss Mass once in a
while, but I knew better, and when I came away
I promised Nan I’d go every Sunday, unless I positively
could not go. I don’t bother much with religion,
but I keep inside the Church, sort of on
the last step, in the vestibule!”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Cicely!” cried Rodney. “Drop the
thing. You aren’t the girl to let stuff that no one
knows a thing about get hold of you. It’s silly to
hang on to a chimera, and it’s dishonest, cowardly
to be afraid to chuck it. Make a break right here,
Cis, and come with me early next Sunday morning.
I used to learn catechism myself; I’ve learned now
that no one has any right to try to teach it. Chuck
that nonsense, brave, free, honest Cis; believe me,
you’d better! And it only means being honest with
yourself; if you believed in it, you’d never hang
around that last step of yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Cicely looked at him gravely, with troubled eyes.
Then she said slowly:</p>

<p>“I’ve often thought exactly what you say, Rod;
I’m afraid I’m not honest. Then again I think I
am honest in trying to keep hold. You know
there’s something in the Gospel about there being
virtue in the hem of the garment; I don’t like to
drop the wee edge I’m holding. It’s something
like the code, you know, Rodney dear; I can’t
learn it easily, but I’d never think of giving it away—don’t
you see?”</p>

<p>“Cis, Cis, Cis, <i>drop</i> it! It’s a danger; it’s your
enemy, it’s my enemy! That horrible system will
wreck your life! Cis, for my sake, in pity say
you’ll come with me on Sunday, and cut out the
Mass! Cis, it’s a test, Cis; you <i>must</i> come! Cis,
Cis, for my sake?” Rodney spoke quite wildly,
crushing her hands in his.</p>

<p>Cis looked at him, frightened, and then a great
tenderness flooded her face, a look that it had never
worn before.</p>

<p>“All that isn’t true, Rod; it is sheer nonsense, but
one Sunday can’t matter. I’ll go with you, if you
care so much to have me,” she said gently. Then
as if a new fear came upon her, she added: “Dear
old pal of mine!” hiding behind a phrase.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

CABLE STRANDS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night Cis took the pins out of her hair
and let it fall around her, like a screen of
molten metal which miraculously could envelop
and not sear her. It shone above her white petticoat
and over her bare arms and shoulders so resplendent
that it was a pity that there was none
to see it, though Cis felt no such regret. She did
not consciously see herself as she stood before her
mirror, letting down her Brünhilde-like tresses;
her mind was filled with other thoughts, and she
turned from the glass to switch off the electric light
the better to follow out these thoughts and their
conclusions.</p>

<p>She went over to the window and seated herself
in a low chair, her right foot boyishly resting on
her left knee that she might easily remove its shoe,
but having removed it she absent-mindedly let it
drop on the floor and stroked her silk-stockinged
instep, forgetful that normally one takes off its
mate when one shoe has been removed.</p>

<p>Cis was reliving her outing with Rodney that
afternoon; it gave her food for new and serious
thought. Rodney had definite and adverse views
in regard to religion from her views and, apparently,
he was especially adverse to hers, to the Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Faith. This surprised her. She had thought of
him as indifferent, with an indifference not greatly
unlike her own, the difference being that she was
indifferent within her faith, while he was indifferent
outside of any faith; the difference between
two persons without an appetite, one seated at a
table, the other resting in an ante-room. Yet this
was an exaggeration of the situation as she had
previously conceived it. Cis meant to keep her
Faith, somewhat as one keeps a valuable piece of
lace, not letting it get lost, but not often getting it
out of its storage drawer. Rod, however, had
pleaded with her, speaking with impassioned earnestness,
not to adhere to the Church, to cast it
off as a shackle. She had been amazed to find that
he cared, violently desired to get her to drop out
of her Church. Why did he? What difference
could it make to him that she held to it, provided
that it did not get in the way of their friendship?
If she bothered him with it, tried to convince him
of its truth, let it come between them in any way,
behaved about it as Nan would, for instance, Rod
might justly consider it a nuisance, but as it was,
why did he mind? He had said that he had once
learned catechism. What catechism? Episcopalian?
Cis thought that Lutherans, and Presbyterians
also, had a catechism, but she was not conversant
with the ways of the Protestant sects. It
could not have been the Catholic catechism? In
that case Rod himself had once been to Mass, had
probably been instructed and received the Sacraments
as she had. But this was not likely; Cis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
did not believe that G. Rodney Moore had ever
been within the Church. Perhaps poor Cis found
it hard to believe that anyone who had ever been
actually within her could ever be actually outside
of her.</p>

<p>She had promised Rod to go with him out into
the country early on Sunday morning, to do which
she would omit Mass. A mortal sin? That was
what she had been taught, but she had missed Mass
before, for less cause. Poor Rod! He had so
eagerly begged her to do this for him! He showed
such intense feeling about it; it seemed to matter
to him beyond the intrinsic importance of taking
that special train, going to that particular place on
this coming Sunday. Again: why? But how could
it be a mortal sin to gratify the dear fellow? She was
not going to give up the Church, of course, but it
did go rather far in some things, notably in the
matter of turning meat-eating on forbidden days,
and Mass-omission on commanded days into a mortal
sin. She intended to remain a Catholic, but it
could hardly be that missing Mass deliberately on
a Sunday would shut one out of heaven if she
died that night unshriven, uncontrite. She hated
to break her promise to Nan for the first time;
she would write Nan in the morning and tell her
that she should not be at Mass on Sunday, but not
to mind; she would go other Sundays. It was fair
to let Nan know that she was breaking her promise;
letting her know seemed to lessen the breach of
faith with nice Nannie. She must also hasten
to advise her to marry Joe Hamilton. Funny little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Nannie! As though she would not marry him anyway!
Nan was fond of him, Cis was sure of that,
fond enough of him to predict the marriage happy,
but Cis thought that she might have been equally
fond of another nice boy; Joe was a nice boy. It
was all right for Nannie; Cis recognized in her
the woman whose children would be the absorbing
devotion of her life, her husband would be
sure to drift pleasantly into second place. It was
all right for Nan, but it would not do for Cis!
If ever she married it would be a man whose presence
blinded her to all other creatures; whose life
and death included her own; she would worship
him, live for him, breathe in him, count nothing
costly that contributed to his welfare, even to
his pleasure. She would be good to her children,
love them, look after them to the best
of her ability, but—weigh them in the scale
with her husband? Preposterous! She would
be first of all what Eve was to Adam, his
mate superaboundingly. Why had that handsome,
bad-tempered Davenport girl acted as she
had acted? She wanted Rod. Why did she?
Cis felt a fierce sort of fury toward her, and
clutched Rod in her thoughts; she gloated over him
and over the thought that the Davenport girl could
not take him from her. She had never before been
dominated for even an instant by an unreasoning,
overpowering hatred for a person, as if she would
cut her down as she stood, if she moved hand or
foot upon her preserves. <i>Her</i> preserves! What
did it mean? Jealous? But what did that mean?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Of all things, what did <i>that</i> mean? She, free,
frank, comradely Cis Adair, whom all the boys had
liked, who had liked them all in return, whose
pulses had never quickened at the thought or sight
of any one of them, much less her heart contracted
as hers did now in thinking of this.</p>

<p>Cis was not stupid; she knew what it meant.
With a great wave of terror, of resistance, of joy,
of triumph, of profound humility, she laid her
head down on her bare white arms, folded on the
window sill, and her splendid red hair fell over
her as the outward symbol of the royal garment
which she had donned, the vestment of her womanhood.
For Cicely knew that she had come into
the kingdom of her own self, her life’s crisis. Never
again should she be the old careless, free, light-hearted
Cis. A loss, perhaps, but at what a gain!
She lifted her face, wet as the light of the street
electricity fell upon it, and pushed back her masses
of red-gold hair from her hot cheeks.</p>

<p>“Miss Mass for him! Yes, oh, yes! I’d lose my
soul for him, if it would make him happy!” she
cried aloud, rising to her full height and stretching
her arms upward with a royal gesture, as though
she at once renounced and received.</p>

<p>Cis arose early the next morning to carry out her
intention to write to Nan. She wrote rapidly, at
gossipy length, on a writing case resting on her
knee, seated at the window where she had sat long
on the night before.</p>

<p>She told Nan all about events in the office; her
struggles with the code; about women boarding at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Mrs. Wallace’s, whose idiosyncrasies she touched off
to the life, with merry ridicule which was keen, yet
not unkind. Only at the end of the letter she
turned serious. “Nannie, dear,” she wrote, “of
course I say marry Joe, though I’m mean enough
to be a little sorry to let you marry anyone. If
you love him, that is all. You must love him, or
you would not consider it at all. He is a lucky
fellow, but he is all right himself. You have my
blessing. It is everything to love someone with
all your heart, but if he loves you, too—Oh,
Nannie, you are in luck, my dear! Though I
should think a great, tearing love would always be
returned; simply melt the other one. I’d never
hesitate over <i>anything</i> if I loved a man—you silly
little thing! I’ll see you some day, before you’re
married, I hope. By the way, speaking of nuptial
Masses, I’m going to cut church next Sunday;
wanted to tell you I’m breaking my promise this
once. I’ve got a fine pal here—I told you about
him—he wants me to do something; go off too
early Sunday morning to get in Mass, too, and he
wants it so badly that it’s right to give him the
happiness. I’d do more than that to make him
happy. I don’t suppose it really is a damning sin
to miss Mass, but I guess I’d go to hell, if it would
make things easier for him. So now you can see
how I feel about this pal o’ mine! There was one
of him made, and then the mold was broken! I’m
happy, but I’m not at all sure he’d go as far as
purgatory for me. Your loving Cis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Cis read her letter over with her cheeks aflame,
her eyes wet, her breath short.</p>

<p>“Well, she won’t show the letter, that’s one thing
sure, and I never could see why it is anything to
be ashamed of that you love someone like mad!
You can’t begin to love a man the instant he asks
you to! Nan will say: ‘She’s still honest Cis, that’s
one sure thing!’ Poor little mouse; she’ll worry
her head off; probably think he’s a Jew with a
Calvinistic mother, or something!”</p>

<p>The hours that must pass before that early train
started from Beaconhite on Sunday morning sped
fast for Cis, in spite of her eagerness for the time
to come. The feeble undercurrent of regret for
her choice of man instead of God, for her broken
promise to Nan, she stifled; indeed it hardly needed
her attention, so eager was she now for a whole day
with Rodney, so sure that he was going to take her
into pleasant and beautiful places, show her how
to grow ever happier with him.</p>

<p>She arose much earlier than was necessary,
dressed carefully in the golden brown tailored suit,
with its accompanying smart, small hat of golden
brown beaver, a bright wing of henna-orange laid
on its brim its sole trimming, the new suit which
was her pride and which Rod had said made her
look “like the twin sister of Phoebus Apollo.”</p>

<p>Cis went out of the house and ate a hasty breakfast
at a restaurant because she was leaving before
Mrs. Wallace’s regular breakfast hour. She hurried
so fast that she had considerable spare time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
on her hands and walked to the station to fill it
in; Rod had asked her to meet him there because
there was risk of missing their train if he came to
fetch her from her boarding place.</p>

<p>Cis was surprised to see that there was a look of
relief, as well as great joy on his face when she
appeared; he was already waiting for her.</p>

<p>“Ah, my Autumn Maiden!” he cried, seizing her
hand tightly. “I don’t know why, because you’re
a girl of your word, but somehow I was afraid
you’d get cold feet at the last minute and not turn
up! Awful glad you didn’t, Holly! You’re a
Maple Tree Symphony in that rig! My, but you’re
stunning, Holly!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Rod! As though I didn’t know I
wasn’t pretty!” cried Cis, her whole face spilling
over rapture.</p>

<p>“Pretty? Perhaps not; I said stunning! You
don’t give a fellow time to consider whether you’re
pretty or not,” rejoined Rodney. “You’re mighty
easy to look at! No, you’re not, by jiminy! It’s
hard afterward, anyway!”</p>

<p>“If you talk stuff to me, Rory O’Moore, I’ll turn
around and go home,” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“Then I won’t, not till the train gets to pulling
fast! Had anything to eat? It’s a beastly time to
ask you to turn out, but I’m not regulating this
railroad!” Rodney said.</p>

<p>“Had my breakfast outside, not to bother Mrs.
Wallace,” Cis told him. “Ate oodles.”</p>

<p>“Doubt it. Never can trust a girl to feed herself
when she’s got anything better to do,” Rod<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
corrected her. “I’ve provender in that basket you
see at my feet; some pretty nifty sandwiches, fruit,
candy, iced coffee, in a cold thermos. It will hold
you alive till we get dinner. We’ll have one dinner,
that I promise you! Ever hear of Pioneer
Falls? They’re seventy miles from here, through
as pretty a country as you’d ask for, and the falls
are as good as they’re advertised to be. But the
main consideration is that there’s a hotel there
which sets up the best dinner I ever ate anywhere,
and let me tell you I’ve knocked around some, and
I’m a connoozer of food! So don’t you worry,
Holly, that you’ll wither and fade away in my
hands!”</p>

<p>“Not a worry, Rod! I’m not afraid of what will
happen to me in your hands,” Cis assured him
with a gay little laugh, but her eyes expressed something
remote from laughter.</p>

<p>“By all that’s truthful, Cicely, if anything unhappy,
or unfortunate ever came to you at my
hands it would be because you would not let my
hands work freely for your good,” Rodney said,
with such emphasis that Cis looked startled, but
he immediately added: “Our train’s made up,
Holly: Let’s get our places; better than standing
here.”</p>

<p>He led her through the gates, his tickets ready
in hand; selected seats on the shaded side, luckily
the one which gave the better view of the country
which they were to traverse; arranged her coat on
a hook; had the porter bring a footstool to lay before
her chair; settled himself; swung his own chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
full in front of hers and sank back to gaze at her
with eyes which needed no tongue to interpret
them.</p>

<p>Cis knew that the intimacy of this early journey,
with all the world excluded from their consciousness,
with its inevitable suggestion of other journeys,
always together, especially of one other journey
which this almost might be, so fast, so blissfully
her heart was beating, Cis knew that it was
to Rodney, as to herself, a new rapture, poignant,
almost unbearably delicious in its present, and in
its future promise. She knew as well as if he had
spoken, that Rodney Moore loved her and intended
to tell her so; to ask her to go with him on all
his ways till death.</p>

<p>She realized that this day was to be filled to
overflowing with that tremulous, delicate bliss
which preludes those unspoken words, when both
man and woman know that they are to be spoken
and how they will be answered, a bliss that almost
surpasses the joy of full possession, as anticipation
always must surpass fulfilment, the mystery of
dawn be lovelier than the full noontide.</p>

<p>“Shall we go to Niagara instead, Holly?” asked
Rodney, bending toward her.</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I would rather see Pioneer Falls!
Niagara is too big,” Cis said quickly, catching the
significance of his allusion to the conventional
bridal-tour point, resolved to keep this day under
the glamor of what was to follow it, not to let him
speak yet. “Besides, I couldn’t get to the office
at nine-thirty from Niagara! Rod, I haven’t seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
you to tell you! The code straightened out for
me yesterday, just as I knew it would, suddenly,
sometime! I’ve got the horrid thing so it will eat
out of my hand!”</p>

<p>“Good for you! You’re a great one, Holly
dear!” Rodney answered, settling back into his
chair, following her lead.</p>

<p>The train took them through beautiful scenes
of farmland, valleys and hills, beside a peaceful
river, through small forests, everything, everywhere
glowing with October colors, “like Cis,” as Rodney
said. Neither Rodney nor Cis were inclined to
talk; it was too beautiful for comment, too sacred
for small talk, this lovely setting of their romance,
also rapidly nearing its destination.</p>

<p>Pioneer Falls was the name of the station. Rodney
picked up his basket and preceded Cis to a
small motor car, billeted: “For hire,” which took
them to the falls.</p>

<p>Here they climbed steep paths, and descended
long, narrow steps, to see the falls from above and
below, hushed by the wild and solemn beauty of
their setting, chilled by the evaporation of their
heavy waters, the dense shade of their surrounding
pines and hemlocks.</p>

<p>“It’s not half-bad to get into a dining room after
all that, is it, Holly?” asked Rodney when they had
seated themselves at a small table tête-à-tête, and
the waiter had withdrawn, after sending Cis’s blood
to her hair by asking whether “Madame would take
lettuce, endive, or salade Romaine?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the smallest fraction bad, Rod,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
Cis, grateful to him for not taking advantage
of the waiter’s mistake. “And I’m ravenous in
spite of your lunch!”</p>

<p>Over the demi-tasse at the end of dinner Rodney
lighted a cigarette and smoked silently, scrutinizing
Cis.</p>

<p>“What?” she asked him, looking up to catch his
gaze.</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you didn’t think that it had
been better, wiser, more natural, after all, to come
off with me, when we like so much to be together,
without going to church? Don’t you honestly
think, little Holly-Cis, that we hallow this day?”
he promptly answered.</p>

<p>“Well, Rod, I’ve been perfectly happy,” Cis
answered. “I suppose, maybe, once in a way—”
She stopped. “Funny you brought that up,” she
went on. “I’ve been thinking ever since that day
of what you said. What catechism was it, Rod,
that you studied? What are you?”</p>

<p>“The penny catechism, my dear; Third Plenary
Council of Baltimore, I believe they said it was.
Who made you, et cetera,” replied Rodney.</p>

<p>“Catholic? Are you a Catholic?” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“Now, Holly, do I look it, or act it?” demanded
Rodney. “No, my dear; I’m nothing, but they did
start me on the same catechism you had; my people
are all Catholics.”</p>

<p>“Left the Church?” Cis looked startled.</p>

<p>“You funny child! When you don’t care tuppence
about it!” Rodney laughed at her.</p>

<p>“I dropped it; that’s better said. I don’t believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in it. They tried to control me in matters
of my personal rights as a man. They would interfere
with me now if they could. They will
with you, if you let ’em. They’ll ruin your life,
my Cicely. All wrong, all wrong! I want you to
drop it, too. Cicely, believe me, it will warp you,
destroy your God-given instincts and desires; ruin
your life, Cis! I am free now to do as seems good
to me; I want you to be free with me. I believe
there’s a God, though I never heard anyone prove
it who tried to, but I believe it. You keep your
faith in Him, if you want to, but drop this Church
business, with its laws. Cicely, I am afraid, <i>afraid</i>,
I tell you, to think of your sticking blindly to all
that! Let it go. You needn’t abjure it, do anything
formal, but let it go. Go around to lectures,
Sundays, or, what’s better, come with me out into
clean, still places and we’ll read the poets and philosophers,
and have music—I play the violin fairly
well, Holly, dear; you haven’t heard me—yet!
Drop it, Cis, for both our sakes, I beg of you!
This is one of the things I brought you here to-day
to say. I’ve studied; I know the thing from top
to bottom. Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Why do you care so much, Rod? You look
half wild when you speak of it. Why do you care?
What difference would it make to you if I kept
on in my half-way Catholicity?” Cis asked more
puzzled than impressed by his plea.</p>

<p>“Why do I care?” Rodney burst out, then
checked himself. “Oh, Cicely, because it separates
us! Child, you don’t know; I do! As sure as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
sun rises and sets it will break your heart and
plunge me into wretchedness and despair if you
continue, even in your half-way, as you call it.
There is no half-way. Either you are a Roman
Catholic, or you’re not. You may be a cold one,
or a hot one, but one you are, unless you drop it
wholly. It is a barrier between us.”</p>

<p>“Rod, what foolishness!” cried Cis. “We shall
be—friends—whether I’m in or out of the Church.
Am I narrow-minded; are you? And if I were
good you might come back!”</p>

<p>“Not I! Never!” cried Rodney. “Cis, my Holly,
my bright, hope-giving, joy-giving Christmas Holly,
you’ve done for me what I never thought could be
done! I was wretched, and you have healed me.
Will you plunge me down again?”</p>

<p>“No, Rod; I couldn’t do that,” Cis said simply,
softly. “I don’t see how being a Catholic could
do that, but if it did—”</p>

<p>“You’d give it up?” Rodney eagerly interrupted
her.</p>

<p>“I don’t say that,” Cis spoke with slow consideration,
weighing her words. “I don’t see how I’d
ever be able—But I couldn’t hurt you either, Rod!
Can’t it just go on? I’m not one bit pious; I don’t
see how it could bother you if I went to Mass
Sundays, and once in a long while to confession?”</p>

<p>Rodney looked at her long without speaking.
“It’s up to me, I see,” he said at last, and Cis accepted
what seemed to be a concession to her, although
she had no conception of its terms.</p>

<p>And then there happened one of those trifling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
things which so often sway human decisions and
actions. Two shabby, dirty little Italians had been
looking in at the door, unnoticed by Rodney and
Cis. Now there came the landlord, blustering, to
chase them away with harsh words, and the children
turned to go, the little girl bursting into frightened
tears, the boy muttering something, helplessly
fierce.</p>

<p>Instantly Rodney sprang up and hurried to the
door.</p>

<p>“Here, come back here! Wait!” he cried.</p>

<p>He turned to the landlord. “What harm were
the little scraps doing? They may be hungry.
Get them a half a pie apiece, and a lot of cake,
and nuts, chestnuts! They’d be sure to like chestnuts!
And coffee, big cups, plenty of milk and
sugar, and some oranges, and put it on my bill,”
he ordered.</p>

<p>“I won’t have dirty children in here,” cried the
landlord.</p>

<p>“Dirty! Dirty! Weren’t you ever dirty when
you were a small boy? But who asked you to
have them in here? There’s room outside on the
grass. Good gracious, you have enough left over
every meal to feed half a dozen kids. Set ’em
up on me!” Rodney ordered impatiently, and soon
he and Cis had the satisfaction of seeing each child
blissfully struggling to circumvent the contents of
the juicy half of an apple pie from attaining its
release, backward from the crust, as it was deeply
bitten.</p>

<p>It was a small thing, yet it set Cicely’s heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
glowing with tender, admiring love for this big-hearted,
gallant Rodney, who flew to the rescue of
the helpless, and gave food and happiness to God’s
little ones. Illogically, it seemed to prove Rod
right in saying that the Church and fidelity to it
did not matter. Had he not left it, and yet he
shared with beggars, like a modern version of St.
Martin of Tours?</p>

<p>“You are great, Rod!” Cis said proudly as she
stood with her eyes on the children outside the
window, and Rod, helping her on with her coat,
watched them also, over her shoulder.</p>

<p>He had an uncanny way of reading her thoughts.
Now he whispered into her ear, though there was
no one near to hear:</p>

<p>“You may give up the practices of religion, yet
not give up true religion, my Holly! I’m not all
bad, though I don’t confess my sins!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

ATALANTA’S PAUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THE only defect in this sort of a day is that it
has to end so early. It makes things seem
thin and flat to pick up and start back on a train
leaving a few minutes past three,” grumbled Rodney,
putting Cis into her car chair and bestowing
himself opposite to her, as they had come up to
Pioneer Falls.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it doesn’t!” Cis contradicted him
happily. “Don’t be greedy, Rory! Greedy and
ungrateful. Think what a beautiful day, and—four,
six, ten—it will be more than ten hours long
by the time we get home!”</p>

<p>“Ungrateful I’m not; but greedy? Well, why
shouldn’t I be? Hungry people are greedy, especially
for the kind of food that best nourishes
them. Philosophy is all very well, but it’s not
always a satisfactory symptom! Don’t you be too
easily satisfied, Miss Holly Adair! One day
couldn’t satisfy me; it whets my appetite!” Rodney’s
eyes were literally devouring, his voice sharp.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Rod!” Cis said softly. “I’m not exactly
easy-going. One day at a time! They sing
a silly hymn at church, all about not praying for
anything, not even to be good, except ‘just for to-day,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
when of course we’re saying all the time:
‘Now, and at the hour of our death,’ and we’re
made to pray for final perseverance! But ‘just for
to-day’ comes in all right now; this is our day,
and a pretty nice one! I’ve been happy all day
long, and we’re still happy, with two hours and
a half ahead, and I love to ride on the train. A
whole day happy is a big thing!”</p>

<p>“Cis, you speak as if you were afraid! There
are years of happy days ahead, my girl! When I
first knew you, Holly dear, I thought I’d never seen
a creature who had passed the twenty-first birthday,
who was so absolutely without a thought of
the morrow as you were.” Rodney looked at Cis
questioningly.</p>

<p>“Ah! When you first knew me!” Cis breathed
the words so softly that Rodney leaned forward
to catch them. “I’m changing fast, Rod; I have
changed; I’m getting tamed. Happiness scares you
when you know you’re happy. Before I came here
I was happy, but it was the way kids are happy.
I didn’t know I was happy; just went along as if
I was a boy, whistling. Now—I think about it.”
Cis pulled herself up short, then she added: “They
tell you that life isn’t particularly happy when you
get well into it, that happiness is not meant to last.
I suppose what everybody says is true; how can I
help being afraid? But it’s a queer thing: I’m
happier when I’m afraid than I was when I wasn’t
afraid one bit!”</p>

<p>Rodney smiled on her, well-content with her
unconscious revelations, or was it that Cis was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
trusting, so honest that she was conscious of revealing,
yet did not mind it?</p>

<p>“Do you believe that you will not be happy,
Holly dear? That <i>we</i> shall not be happy? Do you
believe all these croakers who try to make you
think life is a dismal thing, and all true happiness
is beyond the grave? That’s religion’s talk! Don’t
you heed it. Of course no clock strikes twelve
every hour, but you’ll see what bliss life holds, and
that we’ll keep tight grasp on it, provided you steer
straight. Why, little kid Cicely, you’ve no more
notion of what bliss is ahead of you than a small
brown bunny out in those woods yonder! Believe
me, you glowing, gorgeous-tinted Holly, you will
laugh at your fears when you get over the drunkenness
of the joy you’re going to have!” Rodney
smiled at Cis with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Cis smiled back at him, her breath a little short,
but her candid eyes looked into his unafraid.
Whatever Cis feared or dreaded, it was nothing
within the compass of Rodney’s control; to him
she trusted herself completely.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair, her hat in her
lap, luxuriously rumpling her hair by rolling her
head slightly on the chair’s plush back. Her face
grew grave and sweet as her thoughts travelled onward
from Rodney’s promise of lasting happiness
to her own conviction that sorrow must come. It
did not matter greatly as long as fundamentals held.
Rodney’s “<i>we</i>” destroyed fear. Womanlike, she
felt that sorrow that was shared would in itself
hold a sweeter joy than happiness; that if she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
lighten a burden for Rod there would be no weight
in the heaviest burden upon herself. The prescience
of the woman showed Cis the profound
meaning of a true marriage; not, first in importance,
to be happy together, but to learn to be
happy in being unhappy together.</p>

<p>“Cis, I did not know that you could look like
that!” cried Rodney suddenly. They had been
silent for a little space, and he was watching Cis’s
changing expression with awe and wonder, unable
to follow her mental processes, yet guessing their
course.</p>

<p>“You look at me so strangely, yet as if you
hardly saw me.”</p>

<p>“I see you, Rod, but farther than in that Pullman
chair. How did I look at you?” Cis asked.</p>

<p>“As if I were a baby, or a bird with a broken
wing; I know you’d look like that at either of those
things!” Rodney answered slowly.</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” she said simply. “Then, afterward,
I was thinking how dear and good you were
to those forlorn children, and how fine it was to
be good like that, yet strong and brave, and what
a lovely day you’d made for me, too!”</p>

<p>“Sweet Cicely! I don’t believe that you’ve the
least suspicion of your own value!” Rodney cried,
sincerely moved by her humility, which was less
humility than the lack of all self-seeing.</p>

<p>He lay back, still watching her, while she looked
dreamily out of the window at the flaming trees
rushing past them in units of beauty, massed into
a splendid whole. He was thinking: “She has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
been utterly content and happy the livelong day!
She will soon get around to thinking that the day
was complete, and completely innocent, without
Mass; I’ll have no trouble turning her away and
holding her fast!”</p>

<p>Rodney had a strong reason for wanting to get
Cicely to drop her Church, as he had done; he
was delighted to believe that there would be no
obstacle before him there. But Rodney was wrong
in thinking that Cicely was tending toward easy
weaning from it. She was remembering that she
had deliberately stayed away from Mass that morning
in order to gratify Rodney; she was determining
that she would not do so again. Hitherto she
had not felt any more longing for God than had
one of His young four-footed creatures; she had
played in His sight, innocently as to the actions
condemned by man, careless of His service. She
had made her First Communion with awe and
faith to a degree, but without the enkindling of her
soul. It did not mean much to her, although she
would have answered correctly any question in the
catechism relating to the two sacraments for which
she had then been prepared. She had no mother,
no one to whom her approach to her God mattered
vitally, as it must to a mother whose twofold love
for her God and her child breathlessly watches
their compounding. Cis had gone on through her
brief years to the present, sound in mind and body,
wholesome and true, but with not much more
spirituality than a kitten. Now she began to grope
for God, afar, dimly; she wanted to find Him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
give Him to Rodney. For Rodney she wanted the
best. Like Portia, she began to reach out after
greater values with which to deck herself that she
might stand high in his regard, be fit thus to stand.
And she took her first, actually seeking steps toward
God to find Him, the one, all-embracing God
in order to give Him to Rodney. Rod had drifted
away; he was not like her; he had deliberately
turned from his Church. Well, she had heard of
a woman, a saint—her name was something that
sounded like Money—who had brought her son
into heaven. Surely! St. Augustine, it was, and
his mother, Monica! She, Cis Adair, was by no
means a saint, but she might do that, too, if Rodney
loved her well enough. And he did love her!
How he looked at her, with eyes that made her
own drop and her cheeks flush, and then with such
gentle tenderness that she could weep. He was not
going to tell her to-day that he loved her; she was
glad of that; she would like to hold off that revelation
in spoken words a little longer. It was so
beautiful to look up and surprise its revelation
in his handsome, dear face, and pretend to herself
that she had not been sure that she should
see it there! She was a bad girl to have indulged
him by omitting Mass that day, yet how happy it
had made him, and how happy it made her to
make him happy! Perhaps it was not so bad, just
this one time! After this she would keep to Mass
faithfully and coax Rodney there with her. Curious
that the Beaconhite church where she went,
the one nearest to her boarding place, had no Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Mass before eight! She thought there were
always earlier Masses. It was partly the fault of
St. Francis Xavier’s church that she missed Mass
to-day; if there had been one at six she could have
heard it before she took the train. She did not
push herself to state in her thoughts whether she
was entirely sure that she should have done so.</p>

<p>“You have not spoken for a half hour, Holly!”
Rodney rebuked Cis at last. “What are you thinking
about? We’re getting into Beaconhite, and
you’re cheating me!”</p>

<p>“Thinking—thinking—Oh, about something like
the suffrage; woman’s influence!” cried Cis arousing,
puzzled at first how to answer, then answering
with laughter in her eyes, her one dimple playing
just beyond the deep, sweet corner of her lips.</p>

<p>“Great trick not to be precisely a pretty girl, yet
look so much better than pretty ones, Holly!” cried
Rodney involuntarily, remembering Gertrude
Davenport and her tiresome perfection of beauty.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk to the house, Rod,” suggested Cis,
when they came out of the station into Beaconhite’s
main street.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk to the restaurant first of all!” Rodney
amended her proposal. “I’ve no notion of being
conveyed to the hospital on an ambulance call,
perishing in the street from inanition!”</p>

<p>Accordingly they walked briskly toward the
small hotel in a cross street, several blocks from the
station, where, Rodney affirmed, “there was the
most decent chef in Beaconhite.”</p>

<p>They came upon a block where there had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
a fire; cordons were stretched across the sidewalk,
into the road; within them a blackened mass of
still smoking débris was all that was left of what
that morning had been a block of small houses,
each house divided into four- and five-room tenements
at low rentals. Just as Cis and Rodney came
up there emerged from the side street, evidently
coming around from the rear of the burned block,
a tall, thin figure in a long black coat; Cis instantly
recognized Father Morley, and as quickly he recognized
her, at least for one whom he had been seeing
at the eight o’clock Mass. He possessed the natural
gift of retaining faces in his memory, a gift heightened
to the highest degree by the training of his
Order, and his intense interest in the soul behind
each face.</p>

<p>Cis, meeting his deep-set, keen, gentle eyes,
bowed instinctively. The priest instantly returned
the bow with a smile that lit up his ascetic face as
if a light had been thrown upon it, but in this case
the light came from within, outward.</p>

<p>The Jesuit stepped up to Cis’s side, taking it for
granted that he was welcome.</p>

<p>“Good evening, my child,” he said, and his voice,
which always thrilled Cis when he preached his five
minutes’ sermon from the sanctuary, was still more
moving heard in conversational tones at her elbow.
She saw, too, that his face, thin, ascetic, worn, as
she had seen it at the distance intervening between
the church pews and the sanctuary, was more
deeply graved with fine lines than she had seen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
he looked like a man who had found life a serious
matter, and whose bodily health was not the best.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Father Morley,” Cis replied.</p>

<p>“I do not know your name, but I know that you
belong to me,” said Father Morley. “I am sure
that I have not met you. I see you at my Mass, at
eight o’clock. Have you been long in Beaconhite?”</p>

<p>“No, Father. I came early in the summer. My
name is Cicely Adair; I am Mr. Lucas’ private
secretary. You never have spoken to me before,”
said Cis. “Father Morley, this is Mr. Rodney
Moore.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, Mr. Moore,” said Father
Morley with a quick, comprehensive look at Rodney.
“English More, or Irish Moore?”</p>

<p>“My people on the Moore side came from Ireland,”
said Rodney, uneasy, and omitting the courteous
title at the end of his reply to Father Morley.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” said the priest, as if Rodney deserved
credit for his ancestry. “Though, to be
sure, the English More once meant great things,
when the lord chancelor bore the name who would
not betray his God to save his head! Not that we
would not all reckon martyrdom a splendid prize
for which to hold out! You are in another parish,
not St. Francis’? I don’t recall your face.”</p>

<p>“I’m in the St. Francis Xavier parish,” said Rodney
shortly.</p>

<p>The fine face of the priest changed slightly as he
correctly interpreted this answer.</p>

<p>“I missed you this morning, Miss Adair,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
“You know, a priest gets into the way of unconsciously
looking for familiar faces when he turns to
give the notices and read the Gospel; you are
weekly in the same place. I am glad that you are
not ill.”</p>

<p>“No, Father,” replied honest Cis, making no
excuse to gloss her absence. “I did not go to Mass;
I wanted to take an early train.”</p>

<p>“Good for her; coming straight out, no cringing!”
thought Rodney, misinterpreting Cicely’s
honesty.</p>

<p>Father Morley shook his head. “And not make
the effort required to go to six o’clock Mass first,
or even to the Mass at two? It is worth considerable
effort to keep from offending God,” he said.</p>

<p>“Six o’clock? The eight o’clock Mass is the first
one, isn’t it?” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“No, indeed! Who ever heard of such a late
hour for the first parish Mass in such a large
parish?” exclaimed Father Morley. “We have a
Mass at two a. m. for the newspaper men and other
night workers, trolley men, railroaders, all those
people. The next Mass is at six. Then ours is not
the only church in town! There are nine churches
in Beaconhite, all told.”</p>

<p>“Bad influence, danger ahead!” thought the wise
priest. “I like the girl!”</p>

<p>“I could have made the six o’clock at St. Francis
Xavier’s; I might have asked if there was one, but
I didn’t,” Cis looked straight into the priest’s keen
eyes. “I’m a careless girl, Father; I never thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
so much about these things as Nan—that’s my
friend at home—did.”</p>

<p>“Difficult to think too much of things which are
unending,” commented the priest. “I approve of
Nan and am glad that you have so good a girl
friend.”</p>

<p>He smiled, with a slight sigh, and walked onward
in silence beside Rodney, taking it for granted that
they would continue together as their ways lay in
the same direction. Rodney was at once uncomfortable
and angry, angry that he was uncomfortable.
There was a silent power in this priest that
he felt and resisted; it annoyed him to see that Cis
felt it and did not resist it. It was impossible to
say wherein it lay, but it was there, strong and as
unmistakable as it was indefinable. That it was
the manifestation of the sum total of the gifts of
the Holy Ghost did not occur to him, nor would he
have admitted it, but just as those recorded in the
Gospel cried out against that Power to which they
would not yield, so Rodney in his heart cried out
against this quiet person, walking beside him unintrusively,
saying nothing remarkable, certainly
nothing in direct rebuke. Yet every fibre of Rodney’s
being rebelled, and he felt that Cis was
accepting and readjusting to that implied reproach.</p>

<p>“Must have been quite a fire,” Rodney said, trying
to introduce a topic that was indifferent.</p>

<p>“Indeed it was, a shocking fire,” Father Morley
corroborated him. “It was a gasoline fire in a tenement;
could anything be worse? The young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
daughter of one of the tenants was cleaning gloves,
I understand, in a room which was dark, using a
lighted lamp, and there was not much air in the
stuffy place. She did not realize how far the fumes
would draw to heat where there was so little oxygen.
Not only that tenement burned, but the
entire block. Most of these people had kerosene
oil in cans. Ah, it was a frightful fire! The firemen
saved every life, but several people were badly
burned, dangerously so, and a child was nearly
trampled to death. One of the firemen was hurt;
I came to anoint him and one or two others, but
none will die—thank God!”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose ‘thank God’ is the conventional
phrase, but it doesn’t always fit,” said Rodney with
a bitter, short laugh. “I suppose, too, that all these
people had palm in their houses, blessed especially
for protection against fire, lightning and general
violent catastrophe!”</p>

<p>The Jesuit frowned slightly; Cis looked half-amused,
and he saw it.</p>

<p>“‘Thank God’ is appropriate to whatever befalls
those who trust in Him,” he said. “I would
imagine the blessed palm was in those tenements,
since, in spite of carelessness and ignorance, against
which we cannot expect protection from their
lighter consequences, no lives were lost. I am glad
that you recognize the Providence that intervened,
Mr. Moore; many people miss the province of its
workings.”</p>

<p>“I think that I recognize its province precisely,
Father Morley,” Rodney said. “It is distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
limited. I would say that, if there be a God, He
sets things going, and then leaves them to themselves.
I am not a Catholic, though my people
were.”</p>

<p>“I would hardly have mistaken you for a Catholic,
my poor son,” said the priest quietly. “You
have left the Church of your fathers? Better come
to confession; remove the impediment to faith, and
faith will revive. Strange to throw away that treasure
to acquire which so many sacrifice everything
earthly! My father, for instance, was an Episcopal
clergyman. He came into the Church and suffered
actual want, besides the cruel persecution which
only near and dear kindred can inflict, in order to
possess the Truth and the sacraments. But you
are young and God’s arm is long; you will come
back. A good friend can do a great deal for us!”</p>

<p>The priest smiled at Cis, who looked up at him
with a smile in return, yet a troubled look.</p>

<p>“A <i>good</i> friend can, Father, but lots of people
don’t have <i>good</i> friends—like Nan!” she said, with
emphasis on the adjective.</p>

<p>“All goodness is comparative, my child,” Father
Morley said. “I see that you regret your own deficiencies,
which is a most healthful symptom! It
is everything to be honest, and more than everything
to be humble!” He laughed at his intentional
clumsiness of word. “It must be a little
lonely for you, a stranger here? You say you are
Mr. Lucas’ secretary? I know Mr. Lucas’ brother.”</p>

<p>“It was he who gave me my letter to Mr. Wilmer
Lucas,” cried Cis eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Really? He is a noble man; I don’t wonder
that Mr. Lucas welcomed you,” Father Morley
looked pleased; he was beginning to feel cordial
liking for Cis, with a perceptive anxiety for her
safety. “I know Mr. Lucas, this Mr. Lucas, but he
is not my friend, as his brother is.”</p>

<p>Father Morley did not explain that he had instructed
Mr. Robert Lucas and received his submission
to the Church, and that this new instance
of the Jesuit wiles had made Mr. Wilmer Lucas
cross the street from that day to this whenever he
saw Father Morley coming.</p>

<p>“I have a club of fine girls, all self-supporting,
a jolly, delightful lot, they are! How would you
like to come to one of their ‘open nights’? That’s
what they call the nights when outsiders are admitted.
You’d enjoy them, and they’d take you
right in. No need of being lonely, my child! Let’s
see: Thursday, Holy Hour; Friday the League;
Monday night their private, members-only night;
Wednesday! That’s it! Come on Wednesday, and
see my fine girls!” Father Morley beamed at his
triumphant conclusion.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Father,” said Cis, and meant it.
“I’m not lonely. I am happy in Beaconhite; I
don’t have much spare time. But you are good to
ask me.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit good!” said the priest. “The club is
for girls, isn’t it? And you are a girl, aren’t you?
I turn off here. Good night. Good night, Mr.
Moore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>He held out his hand and Rodney unwillingly
took it.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my poor lad,” said the priest
gently. “Help and bless you.”</p>

<p>He turned to Cis with great kindness, a sweet
gravity, a steady look that told her that he fully
understood her situation and recalled her to her
duty with something of the infinite pity of God and
His love for souls which grope. She knew that the
priest saw that she loved Rodney, and that his
prophecy of the outcome of that love would not
accord with Rodney’s own forecast of her perfect
bliss.</p>

<p>Father Morley held out his hand and Cis put
hers into it, lifting her eyes to the deep-set ones
above her, which rested upon her as if they would
draw her up through their light into the Highest
Light.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my child. Remember that we hear
confessions at St. Francis’ regularly on Fridays and
Saturdays, afternoon and evening, and at any other
time when we are called out, and that a mortal sin
should not rest an hour upon the soul. Come to
see me in the house; I should like to know you,”
he said, ignoring Rodney, whose anger flamed into
crimson in his cheeks and flashed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Father Morley,” replied Cis, ill-at-ease,
conscious of Rodney’s annoyance, devoutly
wishing that “Father Morley wouldn’t,” yet responding
to his summons with a half perception of
its value to her. “I shouldn’t know how to call on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
you; I never knew a priest, not that way. And
I don’t get time, really.”</p>

<p>“And you are not lonely now, and would rather
not have an old Religious bother you, my dear?
Very well; but remember that when you need him,
Father Morley is waiting, and, when things get too
hard to bear, or the strain is too strong for your
young hands to hold back on the ropes, come to
him and he will help your feebleness. Don’t forget,
Cicely Adair, that I shall be watching for you.”</p>

<p>So saying, the Jesuit raised his hat with a courtesy
that included both the young people, and went
off down the side street with a long, striding gait,
his hands thrust into his coat-sleeves, his shoulders
bent forward like a man so accustomed to meditation
that the instant that he was released from talk,
from attention to the needs of others, he was off
and away to other realms than this.</p>

<p>“The old meddler!” exclaimed Rodney. “Don’t
you go near him, Cis! They’ll make you into one
of their idiot women, crazy for novenas and church
work, always lighting candles and trotting around
to ask a priest whether roast pork really is indigestible,
or whether all-wool flannels are better than
half-wool, or whether it is a sin to use a mud worm
for bait, because it looks like flesh, and the fish
eats it, and we eat the fish on Friday! Idiots! I’d
beat a woman, if she belonged to me, and got
feeble-minded in that particular way!”</p>

<p>Cicely moved slightly as if she were awaking;
her eyes were fixed on Father Morley’s retreating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
figure; she had not heard Rodney’s diatribe against
piosity.</p>

<p>“He is good,” she murmured. “I feel as though
the statue of St. Joseph in the church had been
talking to me! He’s like that, like something that
looks like a man, but is ’way beyond one. And he’s
kind, like St. Joseph; he must have been kind!
And he’s ready to do anything for you, but he never
could be common human! I wish——” Cis
checked herself. “Oh, Rod,” she said, turning to
him with a flooding blush upon her face and clutching
his sleeve as if she feared to lose him, “Oh,
Rory, dear, you are hungry; you said you were!
Let’s get a supper for you; I’m not hungrier than a
box-of-crackers supper!”</p>

<p>“Crackers nothing!” growled Rodney, but he
tucked Cis’s hand into his arm. “That restaurant
is right around the corner. The old chap has half
spoiled my appetite! Come along, though, Holly,
and hang on to me; I’ll feed you well!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

PUBLIC FRANCHISE AND PRIVATE
THRALDOM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a matter of state and interstate, if
not of national importance afoot, a lively
correspondence in its regard flying between the
Lucas and Henderson offices in Chicago, Washington
and Beaconhite. A franchise was in question
which must pass, not only the legislatures of three
states, but at last be established or annulled by the
passage of a Congressional Act which would react
upon the state legislatures’ decisions on the franchise,
making it effective or practically without
value. Energetic and clever lobbying to insure this
franchise was vehemently carrying on in the capitals
of the three states concerned, and at Washington
as well. Millions were at stake upon the issue;
immense sums being spent for the passage of the
bill; greater sums waiting those lucky stockholders
who should profit by the enterprise when it was
in working order, notably those who “got in on the
ground floor,” who took up as much of the stock
as was put out on the market for sale, at a price
beyond which shares would rapidly soar once the
inevitably profitable scheme was proved successful.
There would not be much, or comparatively little
of the stock offered upon the market; the corporation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
behind the enterprise was made up of solid
men who could afford to wait for their future big
percentage, secure to them if the thing went
through. They did not purpose to let the general
public share the chippings from the shell of their
golden egg, except in numbers enough to forestall
enmity to it on the ground of its being a private
profit, maintained through public tolerance, via the
Congress and legislatures. Correspondence in regard
to this important matter passed in great bulk
through Cicely’s hands; she was interested in it to
the highest point. The newspapers were full of
allusions to the franchise, opposing it, supporting
it, according to their bias for or against the political
party favoring the measure. It amazed inexperienced
Cis to find that this was the basis of newspaper
influence, never the abstract benefit or harm
to the public at large, which seemed to her mind
the only ground upon which to favor or oppose the
franchise.</p>

<p>Rodney laughed at her, and called her “Donna
Quixote,” a name that Cicely liked because it was
linked with tender mockery in Rodney’s eyes; she
had never read “Don Quixote.”</p>

<p>The correspondence in regard to the franchise
which assailed Cicely’s desk in Mr. Wilmer Lucas’
office was couched in the code that had at first been
such a stumbling block to her, but which she now
read and wrote with complete fluency. It was excitingly
pleasant to get inside information upon a
subject that was occupying so much public attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“I feel as biggity as Brer Rabbit to be so deep in
the know!” she told Rodney. Therefore on the
Monday morning after her Sunday spent at Pioneer
Falls, Cicely started out for Lucas and Henderson’s
office with her mind joyously attuned to anticipation,
the anticipation of an interesting day superimposed
upon the delicious certainty that Rodney
loved her as well as she loved him, better perhaps,
and that it was a matter of a few hours before she
could be his promised wife.</p>

<p>Perhaps she should have been that now, had they
not met Father Morley the previous evening. The
priest had intruded upon the perfect oneness of
her comradeship with Rodney; he irritated Rod,
and, though Father Morley impressed her as a
saint, and attracted Cis herself powerfully, yet Rod
said that priests “were good things to keep away
from,” and if he felt so, then one could not expect
him to find Father Morley’s inopportune intrusion
upon them agreeable.</p>

<p>But how beautiful had been Rodney’s manner
to her, Cis thought, as, in the knowing little hotel
to which he had taken her, he had ordered and
pressed upon her delicious food for which she had
slight appetite, yet of which she ate, coaxed into
eating by the wondrous delicacies and Rodney’s
ministrations to her.</p>

<p>They had not talked upon disturbing subjects,
pleasant or the reverse, but had chatted happily, in
complete harmony, laughing over their own nonsense,
telling each other new bits of confidences,
those insignificant-significant trifles of past experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
which, taken together, make up a mosaic of
complete mutual knowledge. There was nothing
for Cis to tell except school scrapes and triumphs,
funny or piteous things which she had encountered
on her short road so far through life; stories of
people whom she had known, pleasures and annoyances;
her reactions toward them. They were
simple tales to which Rodney harkened with profound
interest, deriving from them an accurate
estimate of this clean-minded, gallant Cis who
loved him, as he saw; whom he meant to marry,
and not Gertrude Davenport with her money,
realizing that in Cis he had found the woman whose
existence his experience had led him to doubt.</p>

<p>In return for her confidences Rodney told Cis
similar stories of his boyhood, of his merry college
days, of victories which he had won on the fields
of sport, and, later, in the field of business competition.
That there was much that Rodney did not
tell her, honest Cis never suspected, still less that
there was a side of his life, parallel with his advancement
in business, upon which he did not
touch. She listened breathlessly to Rodney’s
charming recitals, treasuring up his every word,
so that it surprised him later to find how conversant
she was with his boyhood and youth; proudly
recognizing him as the cleverest and the best of
lads whose present perfection had been clearly
foreshown, missing nothing, because she looked for
nothing beyond his revelations.</p>

<p>The remembrance of these intimate confidences
of the evening before, lay warm at her heart; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
picture of the close-drawn crimson sash curtains in
the leaded window beside them; the cream-white
table, with its heavy cut work doilies; its delightful
copper candlesticks, their parchment shades decorated
by a skilled hand in Persian colors and designs,
made a poetic background for her memories.
Cis went out on Monday morning, whistling in her
mind, her breath keeping up the air soundlessly
against her motionless lips—Cis, the secretary, no
longer whistled in the street as Cis, the telephone
operator, would have done—and she almost ran
into Miss Hannah Gallatin.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” they cried together, as Cis
swerved to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>“I sort of hoped I’d meet you, Miss Adair; I had
an idea you went out about this time,” Miss Gallatin
said, and added: “Mind if I walk along to
talk to you?”</p>

<p>“Glad to have you, Miss Gallatin,” Cis replied
truthfully. “I’ve thought of you lots of times, and
of how kind you were that morning when you asked
me home with you, and advised me about boarding
at Mrs. Wallace’s.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t felt the need of a friend yet, so
haven’t hunted me up, as I told you to in case you
ever did need one?” Miss Gallatin commented.</p>

<p>“I’ve been busy, learning all sorts of new things
in the office——”</p>

<p>“And out of it,” Miss Gallatin interrupted Cis.
“See here, my dear girl, let me ask you bluntly:
Are you engaged to my boarder, Mr. Moore?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Gallatin, but I am really engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
without being! It is exactly the same thing, and
I’d have been engaged when you asked me, if you
hadn’t asked me to-day!” Cis laughed, but Miss
Gallatin shook her head violently, having been
shaking it gently as a running accompaniment and
comment from the first syllable of Cicely’s answer.</p>

<p>“Girl alive, it’s not in the least the same thing!”
cried the gaunt woman energetically. “Making
love to a girl, and tying up to her under bonds are
by no means the same! Men flirt and flit; woo
and walk, and the girls think that there’s so much
honor back of warm looks that they’re as secure
behind a bow as a vow. Now, my honest Cicely
Adair—for I know you’re as straight a girl as walks—these
words may sound alike, but their sounds
and sense are quite different. I’m going to tell you
something about G. Rodney Moore; he was running
hard after Gertrude Davenport a while ago; she’s
a rich beauty, and now he’s dangling after you.
Honorable?”</p>

<p>Cis laughed long and merrily; it is not unpleasant
to have victory over another girl attributed to
oneself, however humble-minded and gentle-hearted
the conqueror may be. Cis began to sing
the once popular song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘But I never knew, dear,</div>
<div class="verse">That I should meet you, dear;</div>
<div class="verse">So let’s forget the girls I met</div>
<div class="verse">Before I met you!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“H’m!” grunted Miss Gallatin. “That’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
answer, though it’s been given as one ever since
Noë’s grandson went gallivanting! Miss Adair,
you’re a good girl not to slap me and bid me go
about my own affairs, but I suppose you know that
I want to befriend you. I know that you go off
seeing the country with my captivating lodger, and
it worries me. I don’t trust that fellow; I never
have. Now you <i>will</i> slap me! You’ll put up with
my meddling, but not with my misjudging your
hero; is that so?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like it,” said Cis, “but I’m sure
you mean it kindly, and can’t help seeing Rod
crooked. In reality he’s splendid, true as steel,
kind—<i>splendid</i>, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“He tells me that he shall not stay with me all
winter, that he is looking about for an apartment, a
small one. Know anything about that?” Miss Gallatin
demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, the absurd fellow!” cried Cis, blushing
furiously to the roots of her brilliant red hair.
“This winter! Mercy! No, Miss Gallatin, I don’t
know anything about it, but I suppose—This winter!
Just imagine!”</p>

<p>“I do hope there’s a deaf and dumb saint who
intercedes for girls in love!” cried Miss Hannah
Gallatin impatiently. “It would be the only one
who could thoroughly understand her! Evidently
you think the apartment means that G. Rodney
expects to cage his bird, but I think that’s by no
means certain. You blind, honest little bat, it
might mean anything else but that! Cicely Adair,
I found out lately, accidentally dropping a book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
out of which a card tumbled—one of G. Rodney’s
books—that he was once a Catholic!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was,” Cis said carelessly. “I knew that.
He doesn’t believe in any form of religion; he
thinks it’s all nonsense, but I’ll learn to be a good
Catholic myself, and then Rod will get straightened
out.”</p>

<p>“Cicely Adair, look out for the man that is not
true to his faith; disloyalty to his God is a mighty
poor argument for his loyalty to a woman. And do
your converting before, not after you marry him!
Something there I don’t like; never have. I’m
afraid for you, Cicely Adair. I wish I had proof—or
else no doubts!” Miss Gallatin looked troubled.</p>

<p>Across the space of several months Jeanette
Lucas’ voice reached Cis as Miss Gallatin spoke;
it said again to her:</p>

<p>“I thought that I should cure his one defect, his
indifference to religion. I know now that he was
false to all things, to me as to God! Cicely Adair,
you’re a Catholic girl; remember this lesson when
you think of marrying.”</p>

<p>Cicely shivered involuntarily, and the chill of
the memory of this warning from the girl whom
she had revered, then pitied, drove out the quick
anger with which she had heard Miss Gallatin’s last
words, and made her answer quietly:</p>

<p>“I think you mean to be good to me, Miss Gallatin,
and I appreciate it, but, please, nothing more
against Rodney Moore to me. I ought not to have
let you say one word! He loves me, as I love him,
and he trusts me as I trust him. I don’t know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
he will say when I tell him that someone warned
me against him and that I let them—of course I
must confess it to him! I shall marry him. There
isn’t anything else to do when the whole world
would be black-empty without him! Even if I’m
to be unhappy, still I must marry him. But I’m
not afraid of being unhappy. How silly, how
wrong, but still more how silly, to suspect people
without a grain of reason! You haven’t the least
proof of Rod’s being anything but what I’ve found
him, the best, as he is the dearest, cleverest, kindest,
biggest, truest man in all the whole wide
world!”</p>

<p>“Forgive my meddling, Miss Adair,” said Miss
Gallatin humbly. “No one ever rescued a girl in
love from her fate, even though she brought tons
of proof against the man. And I have none; you’re
right. Nevertheless—But I’m to say no more! I
like you, my dear; I truly like you, and I’ve known
what it was to love a man madly, trust him utterly,
and find him false and evil! If G. Rodney leaves
my house for that apartment and you’re not domiciled
in it, will you come to board with me? I’d
like to have you under my roof. And the day may
come when you’ll find queer, lean, ugly Hannah
Gallatin better than no one. Like Mrs. Wallace’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; it’s all right,” said Cis, glad to be let
off from answering the previous questions. “It’s
clean, and she gives us lots of good food, but—Mrs.
Wallace’s women boarders are not all my fancy
might paint them!”</p>

<p>“Fancy sketches ’twould be!” returned Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Gallatin. “Women boarders are a species by themselves;
idle, censorious, meddlesome. Hers aren’t
peculiar to Mrs. Wallace; she’s not to blame for
’em; mine are just the same! They’re all alike,
mostly, and when they’re different from the rest,
heaven help the different ones! The things I’ve
seen women, who were supposed to be ladies when
they were away from a boarding house table, do
to get the hearts of the celery—gracious! I’m sure
those at Mrs. Wallace’s pick at you; you’re too gay
and independent to escape! Too young, besides!
Well, that would be the same anywhere, but come
to me if ever there’s a chance. You can’t come
while G. Rodney’s in the house; I won’t have you!
Now, good-bye, my dear! I do like you, and,
somehow, the thought of you anxiously haunts me.
Believe me, if you are happy with G. Rodney and
can bring him back to his faith, if he’ll be to you
what you expect him to be, no one will be more
glad than queer Hannah Gallatin! So don’t hold
a grudge in your memory of me, and come to see
me some Sunday—if you have spare time!”</p>

<p>Cis heartily shook the worn hand which this
peculiar, but sterling woman held out to her. She
resented her suspicions of Rodney, yet in spite of
them, she liked her cordially, and left her with a
surprising warmth for her in her own heart, and a
pity that recognized the tragedy which Miss Gallatin’s
brief allusion to her own perfidious lover revealed.</p>

<p>Cis walked on thoughtfully for a short distance
after leaving Miss Gallatin, her thoughts grave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
almost somber. It was gloomy to know that once
this woman had been young like her, full to overflowing
with the joy which now filled Cicely, joy
which had congealed under the cruellest ice, the
cold of disappointment and disillusionment. But
the perfidy of that older lover did not involve the
perfidy of Rodney. Rodney! The word “perfidy”
was an absurdity in connection with his name!
Cis threw off her depression, squared her shoulders
like a boy, and broke into a swinging pace, softly
whistling: “But I never knew, dear,” the song
which she had hummed replying to Miss Gallatin.
This time, casting aside her dignity as Mr. Lucas’
private secretary, Cis whistled aloud in the street,
albeit softly.</p>

<p>There were piles of letters waiting upon her desk
when Cis sat down to it, letters in ordinary long-hand
and typed letters, but the majority of them
written in the code peculiar to that office and to the
secrets of its clients and associates.</p>

<p>Cis plunged into them, reading and assorting
into piles letters relating to legal affairs, cases in
which Lucas and Henderson, as a firm, were retained;
letters relating to Mr. Lucas’ personal
clients, people who retained him as advisor in their
affairs, rather as a wise man of sterling integrity
than as a lawyer; letters of appeal, or asking information;
last of all, letters in the code relating to
the matter of the pending franchise; reporting its
progress in the three states dealing with it, and
with Congress; the likelihood of the bill passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
which would make it possible; suggestions of means
which would further its success. The mail relating
to the franchise, as well as his personal correspondence,
Cis laid upon Mr. Lucas’ desk; he would not
come in before eleven, or possibly noon that day,
having first gone to the bank to conduct that part
of its business which fell upon him as its president.</p>

<p>Then Cis plunged into correspondence from yesterday’s
notes, which she must write up and dispatch.
She was immersed in this when Mr. Lucas
entered.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Adair,” he said and passed
her to take up the papers which she had laid down,
awaiting him.</p>

<p>He read rapidly, putting aside a few letters for
a second reading, but he merely glanced through
the letters which were not written in the code,
stacking them for a return to them later on; evidently
the one absorbing, pressing matter of that
day was the franchise, soon to be decided.</p>

<p>“Miss Adair, you know a great deal that the outside
world is eager to learn,” said Mr. Lucas, looking
over at Cis as she busily wrote at her desk, a
short distance from his own. “There are many
people’s hopes hanging upon this pending franchise;
many waiting to snatch up the shares of the
new enterprise, to get them at the lowest possible
figure. What would they not give to know now
that the franchise is secured? They could buy to-day
at 32¼, and sell within two months at fifty per
cent above par! A profit not to be despised! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
within a year that profit will at least double. The
newspapers are agog for inside information, for a
tip as to the probabilities of the outcome, partly to
secure a scoop over other papers, partly to serve
political ends. What do you purpose doing with
your knowledge, Miss Adair? Sell out to the highest
bidder? Offer your knowledge, say, to a New
York paper, and make it do something handsome
for you, in return for the advantage you offer it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas spoke with a smile that showed that
he considered Cicely far beyond the reach of
temptation thus to betray confidence. His face also
expressed great satisfaction, even relief. As the
president of a national bank, it might prove unpleasant
for him if the failure of the franchise disclosed
him deeply concerned in its success. Mr.
Lucas was playing with Cis and the fancy of her
betraying him, under the necessity for some outlet
for the satisfaction which his face revealed.</p>

<p>Cis looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>“No; I won’t sell you up, Mr. Lucas,” she said.
“Is it settled then? Is the Big Deal on? Is the
franchise secured?”</p>

<p>“I thought you read the letters, Miss Adair. You
aren’t forgetting the code, are you?” Mr. Lucas
looked half-annoyed, half-amused. “I want you to
go over the mail carefully, and I surely want you
to read the code straight.”</p>

<p>“I did read the letters, Mr. Lucas, and I understood
that they were favorable, but—to tell the
truth, I understood what I read enough to do the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
right thing with them, but the letters did not make
much impression on me; I had something important
on my mind,” candid Cis explained.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas laughed outright. “A girl is a girl,
clever or stupid, faithful or unreliable! I’d wager
I could shrewdly guess the important subject. Important,
mark you! The franchise being a mere
bagatelle! Well, well, Miss Adair, I’ve no doubt
that you did precisely as you say you did, read and
understood, and forgot for really ‘important matters’
when you had read! The franchise is assured,
Miss Adair, and great events are afoot! I am as delighted
as I have been anxious about it. We shall
all profit, but it is my honest conviction that the
profit to the public will exceed the money returns.
Be careful not to know all this, if you please; the
information must not leak out yet, not for two
months more,” Mr. Lucas warned Cis.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep quiet, Mr. Lucas. I’ve been approached
by a few Poll Prys, but—nothing doing!”
Cis laughed gaily, permitting herself a relapse into
the slang which her new dignity had been making
her eschew.</p>

<p>That evening Rodney met Cis just beyond the
door of the building which housed the Lucas and
Henderson offices, when she came forth at nearly
five o’clock.</p>

<p>The sight of him, handsome, faultlessly dressed,
debonair, smiling happily as they came toward
each other, set Cicely’s pulses bounding joyously;
his presence was the sufficient answer to the doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
of him suggested by Miss Gallatin, repudiated by
Cis, yet, like all doubts, hard to silence completely,
even when downed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rod, I’m glad!” cried Cis almost running
over the short distance intervening between them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cis, I’m gladder!” echoed Rodney. “What’s
amiss, Cis? Amiss-Cis; goes along slick, but Cis is
never amiss!”</p>

<p>“I want to confess to you, Rory,” said Cis, as
Rodney turned to walk with her.</p>

<p>“The only one I want you ever so much as to
think of confessing to,” Rodney said approvingly.</p>

<p>“Someone warned me that it wasn’t safe to play
with you, Rory O’Moore, that I’d be sorry later on,
that you weren’t quite, quite all right, trustworthy,
you know. I didn’t really listen; I did not believe,
and I said that sort of talk had to stop, but it was
said, Rod, and I’m ashamed of myself that I let
more than your name get past. I didn’t listen, I
didn’t truly, but too much was said.” Cis poured
out her confession eagerly.</p>

<p>“Who was it? Who was she? Safe to say <i>she</i>, of
course! What else did she tell you? Anything I
ought to know—and that you ought not to know?”
Rodney looked furiously angry, and somewhat
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me who it was; I won’t tell. I won’t
say it was a woman; may have been a man. And
nothing was said, more than I’ve told you; that the
person doubted your being safe for me to play
with,” cried Cis. “I’m sorry I heard more than one
word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“The old gal, I’ll bet! Funny old Gallatin; she
always suspects me,” cried Rodney. “Why, Cis;
why, Holly, my darling, there’s no one on earth half
as safe as I for you to play with! How dares she
think I’d harm you, grieve you? Never any other
man loved a girl as I love you. I’m mad about you,
Cis, you—you glowing Holly-berry! I never
dreamed there was such a girl on earth. When
we’re married—My heavens, <i>when we’re married</i>!
Cis, oh, Cis, you can’t dream how happy we’re to
be! Did she think maybe we wouldn’t marry?
Cis, we shall, we must! You’re going to marry me,
aren’t you, my darling, my glowing ruby-jewel?”</p>

<p>Cis looked up, trembling, forgetful of fear, of
doubt, responding to the call of this love that
blotted out the world with as much ardor as its
summons held. “Yes, oh, yes! I’d die else,” she
said.</p>

<p>Rodney drew her to him oblivious to the highway
and its many passers-by, but Cis came to her
senses, and eluded his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rod, Rory dear, we’re engaged!” she almost
sobbed. “We are really, truly engaged, and isn’t
it beautiful! Do people get engaged like this, without
meaning to, just sort of talking, and then there
you are? And it’s so public, and so queer! But,
oh, Rory O’Moore, it’s so beautiful! What can it
mean, it’s so beautiful?”</p>

<p>“It means that by your birthday, by Christmas,
my Holly-berry, you’ll be in your own home, in
<i>my</i> home, my wife, and that no cold nor storms
shall ever touch my Christmas bride! Oh, Holly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Holly of my heart, red and glowing, thorns for all
else, but for me the crimson fruit of your love!”
cried Rodney, stammering under an emotion which
unconsciously turned back to the phrases of his
Celtic forbears for its expression.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

THE WEAKNESS OF STRENGTH</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202; SEE the whole world through your tresses,
Holly! They cover my eyes as a veil and
everything glows, shines with glory!” Rodney had
said to Cis.</p>

<p>It was true of them both that a joy past realization,
past expression, filled and flooded their ways
and their days. Cicely gave herself up to the rapture
of a love so mighty that it was almost pain;
gave herself with the generosity of a nature honest,
fearless, intense. Rodney found her love for him
far exceeding his expectation of it, and he had expected
to be endowed beyond the average man by
the love of a woman who, more than any that he
had ever known, asked nothing for herself but to
be allowed to submerge herself.</p>

<p>He was delirious, breathless at times when she
bared to him her rare, sublimated passion, yet
there was in her a quality which awed him, while
she enkindled him. Cis loved him with all the
forces of her royal human nature, yet with it she
also loved him with a purity of soul that frightened
the man, ten years her elder, versed in the ways of
lesser women. Crimson as a flame fed by her lifeblood
burned her love upon the altar she erected
to it, but over and above the red flame of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
love, burned a white flame of utter devotion, idealization,
spiritual detachment; it dominated and
sublimated the love that, though it was rare, yet
was lower than this, its supplement. Wonderful in
a girl whose life had not trained her for the highest
form of love, was this purity of aim which Rodney
recognized at all times in her.</p>

<p>Rodney himself arose to reverence this idealized
love, to defer to it. He was not a man whose life
was notably better, nor was it worse than the average
man’s life. He had thrown off his religion because
it would have thwarted him; because its law
bore heavily upon his particular case; because it
never had meant much to him, and this world fully
engrossed him. He meant to be both rich and
happy; he had intended to marry ambitiously, but
Cis had come, with her red hair, and it had burned
like dross everything that would have stood between
her and him. He had fallen in love with
Cicely Adair passionately and honestly; to get her
and hold her his he was more than ready to throw
over any other woman, however full her hands
might have been when he had espoused her. After
he had won Cis, Rodney was ready to stake anything
on himself; he felt that he was sure to get the
worldly goods which he craved. Cis must be first.
Now that he had Cis, he knew that, even if he
missed the riches, he should be rich. She filled his
horizon, filled his eyes and heart, yet she held him
indescribably above himself; she humbly worshipped
him, abasing herself with wonder that such
as he should love her, yet never descended to what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Rodney himself knew was his natural level, nor
ever for an instant suspected that she held him
down while she lifted him up by assuming that he
was the type of man whom Arthur tried to form
to sit at his Round Table.</p>

<p>Cicely mystified Rodney; she was at once flame
and starlight. He could not understand that the
flame was of the sort that burned away dross; that
Cis loved him with such overwhelming love that
she walked under a sense of consecration. He
could not understand, yet he recognized this and
deferred to it in a way that amazed himself when
he came to think it over. He could not risk letting
Cis find him less than she believed him. Her trust
in him, her idealization of him, humbled him and
intrigued him. Could he marry Cis, deceiving her?
Could he undeceive her? After they were married
Cis would learn to accept things as they were; she
would not love him less; she would love him more,
tremendous as her love now was, for then there
would be the complete blending which was marriage.
Cis was not the sort of woman to criticise
her husband. She would understand and justify
him when she was his wife, nor would her slender
hold upon the dominant Old Church be maintained
against the clutch with which she would hold to
her husband. Rodney’s fingers tightened as he
thought how he would hold his wife, although
Rome itself were hurled upon his grasp that held
her. He knew that his love now flooded Cicely’s
whole being with joy; when he was married to her
he would show her that she had known no more of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
joy than the bird in the shell knows of the sunlight
awaiting it.</p>

<p>Cis had received her engagement ring from Rodney,
not the conventional diamond.</p>

<p>Rodney had a friend who was a dealer in
precious stones; from him he had obtained a ruby
perfect in color, beautifully cut, and he had himself
designed its setting. Holly leaves laid one
upon another, points resting each upon the following
leaf, formed the ring; four leaf points converged
to hold the wonderful ruby high to catch the
light. It glowed and pulsated upon Cicely’s slender,
nervous hand as if it refracted the light within
her, the glow of her love for her lover.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rod, my dearest, it’s beyond words to
praise!” sighed Cis, turning her hand to give the
ruby light upon every side. “It’s too wonderful
for me!”</p>

<p>Rodney caught her head between his hands and
kissed and kissed her red hair. Then he crushed
her face against his and held her lips to his in a
long kiss.</p>

<p>“I deserve it,” he said releasing her. “The
ruby is you; how can it be too wonderful for you?
No white diamond for you, but a ruby, like this
one. You are my Holly, my glowing, ruby-red
Holly! My Christmas Gift! Cis, we shall be married
on Christmas Eve? Cis, I beg of you, don’t
ask me to wait longer! That’s almost two full
months! I’ve found the apartment; I haven’t told
you, but it’s a little bit of all right! Christmas Eve
our wedding! Christmas morning, when the bells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
ring, to say for the first time: ‘Good morning, my
wife!’ ‘Good morning, Rod, my own man!’ And
our Christmas breakfast in our own home—no
trips away then; perhaps later!—but I yours, you
mine, wholly, forever, my Holly upon my own
walls! Cis, in mercy—say yes!”</p>

<p>“Rod! Rory, my darling!” Cis caught her
breath, her words almost a cry. “I want to come
and I can’t! It’s too soon, Rod dear! Only two
months; not quite that! I could leap with you into
fire when you call me, yet I can’t marry, not so
soon! Girls—girls—Oh, yes! Girls have to get
ready, get clothes and things, and it takes time,
Rod!”</p>

<p>“Cis, you’re a royal princess, a giver by rank and
nature! Would you put me off with such a mean,
a dishonest excuse? Do you know what you ask
when you ask me to wait? You, the generous, the
unselfish, the royal giver! As though you hadn’t
clothes! If you have enough to go to Lucas and
Henderson’s every day you have enough to live in
your own home, hidden from all eyes but mine—and
they won’t see your clothing, my Holly! We’ll
live only about seventy years, all told; less than
fifty more! Will you waste time? How dare you
waste time, youth time, too! We should have been
married these four years, at least. You could have
been married at eighteen, if I’d have known you
then—No, we couldn’t! I couldn’t have married
you then, my own. You are my own, Cis! Nothing
else is mine! Cis, I’ve had a harder life than
you know; I’m going to tell you when we’re in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
home, sitting down all alone, you in my arms, your
dear red head on my shoulder! But don’t be a
niggard with me, generous Cis! Make up my hard
luck to me. Oh, make it up to me! You’ll wipe
out memory of the word hard luck! Cis, how can
you think of delaying life together? It’s cowardly,
unfair, cold love, and these things are not in you!
Christmas, Holly?”</p>

<p>Rod had pleaded with such quivering earnestness
that Cis paled and trembled before it, swept
beyond her power to hesitate, even beyond deciding.</p>

<p>“My poor Rory! Were you so badly off four
years ago?” she murmured. “But I’d have married
you, if you were a beggar with a little dog on a
string! I’ll come home to you at Christmas, then,
my own Rodney; I’ll keep my birthday with my
husband in my own home. Oh, Rory O’Moore!”</p>

<p>For Rodney had fallen at her feet and was kissing
her hands over and over again, kissing the ruby
which he had placed upon one of them, as if he
feared his own joy, and for the moment dared not
rise to the level of the girl who had shackled her
brave freedom for his sake, who so trusted him and
sacrificed for him.</p>

<p>Three days later Cis received an invitation from
Miss Gallatin to dine and spend the evening with
her. Rodney had told his eccentric, but fine landlady
of his engagement and speedy marriage. In
default of relatives on either side Miss Hannah
Gallatin felt it incumbent upon her to do something
as a mild celebration of what had happened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the more that she had doubted Rodney, and, for
lack of anything else upon which to hang that
doubt, had feared that he was playing with Cis,
would never marry her. Besides this, with the
ardor of her own strong, and comparatively recent
adherence to the Catholic Church, she was anxious
about Cicely’s marriage to a renegade from it,
Cicely, whose own lukewarmness was only too evident.</p>

<p>Miss Gallatin was not an ordinary boarding
house keeper; queer as she was in appearance,
uncouth and almost shabby in attire, she had come
of good stock; her youth had passed in refined,
even luxurious surroundings; she was well-read,
clever, was what used to be meant by “a gentlewoman.”
She was dependent upon her own exertions
for a livelihood because her patrimony had
passed from her wholly into a brother’s hands,
owing to her father’s conviction that nothing of his
must ever be administered by one who would be
likely to use its smallest fraction to benefit that
menace to American institutions, the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>Miss Gallatin did not invite Cicely to dine at the
common table; it was not covenable to expose a
young girl to criticism among her lover’s fellow-boarders;
she was so far from being their concern
that they were sure to watch her closely and later to
comment on her violently.</p>

<p>A small table was spread in a cozy room near the
general dining room and in it Cicely and Rodney
were to dine with their hostess, and a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
whom Miss Gallatin explained to Cicely in private.</p>

<p>“I feel honored to entertain him, the gentleman
whom you’re to meet at dinner, Miss Adair,” she
said. “He’s a great man, doing great things as if
they were less than little ones. He has a fine estate
and plenty of money; is not married. He is not so
much a good Catholic, as an enraptured one; he
consistently puts his faith before all else. He has
travelled everywhere, speaks several languages, has
a great library, reads much, writes, too, a little, I
believe; essays, articles on current questions, giving
the Catholic point of view. He is organizing Catholic
lay men and women to be ready to serve the
Church wherever it is needed, and his quite splendid
big house is the headquarters for this league of
his. He has people staying there all the time who
need what he can give; a chance for a convert to
get on his feet, for instance, one who is impoverished
by coming in, and a chance to find friends if
he is alone, lonely, needing countenance and advice.
He has a teacher of Italian there, to fit
people to stem the tide of theft of Italian immigrants
through bribery by the Protestant sects. All
these sorts of things he does. He is well on toward
forty; a knight riding to rescue, if ever there was
one! I call him Sir Anselm—not to his face! In
fact, I rarely see him. He’s in town, and I’m gratified
to death that he’s going to stay here. He’s
come to see Miss Miriam Braithwaite; she’s a great
friend of his, one of his sort, a convert. His name
is Anselm Lancaster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Cis heard this long tale of the man whom she was
to meet, without actually hearing it; she felt no
smallest interest in this fine gentleman, nearing
forty, who was spending his days, strength and
means for his Church and hers. If she thought at
all of what Miss Gallatin told her as she made her
hair tidy for dinner, it was that he “must be fusty
and musty, pokey and dull to fuss over things like
that.” In the attractive little room where she
dined, Cis was introduced to Mr. Lancaster. She
saw him tall, slenderly built, elegant in dress, fine
of feature, handsome, perhaps, and with a gleam
of pure humor in his eyes which was unexpected to
her in an extremely devout man. Then she forgot
all about him, for Rodney began to talk to Miss
Gallatin, the stranger joined in, and in listening
to Rodney, who did talk well and fluently, Cis forgot
all else, her eyes as well as her cars feasting
upon Rodney’s perfections.</p>

<p>Occasionally Cis spoke, uttering one of her characteristic
quick speeches, much to the point, with
a humorous turn and a keenness of insight that
made Mr. Lancaster look at her attentively, smiling
upon her as if he were ready, desirous more correctly,
to draw her into conversation, but Cis did
not see this, nor did she respond beyond the requirements
of civility, to the remarks to this end
which he addressed to her. It came out that Cis was
secretary to Mr. Lucas, and when he heard this Mr.
Lancaster turned to her with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wilmer Lucas?” he cried. “Lucas and Henderson?
That office is deeply concerned with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
franchise now before the legislature and Congress.
Everybody is agog to know how it is going. I,
myself, am imploring all the saints to get it through!
It will matter greatly to my plans, if it succeeds.
I’m going to be able to found an Italian colony, if
it goes through; give employment to many heads of
families, and save no end of bambini from proselytizing
societies for their destruction! You must
know something about the way the matter is tending,
Miss Adair. Please admit that it is trying, to
feel that the knowledge one needs is just across the
table, but wholly inaccessible, enclosed by the
nimbus of your hair, sacred as a trust.”</p>

<p>“I know all about it,” said Cis. “I handle the
whole correspondence, but I’m not talking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t imagine that I would suspect you of betraying
a trust, still less that I would want information
at that price,” said Mr. Lancaster. “It must
soon be decided and made public. Interesting to
see the inner wheels go around, drop a little accelerating
oil on them in a hidden corner!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Cis. “I like wheels, things getting
done. But I don’t care more about that franchise
than anything else, except that everybody seems to
be wild about it. Rather sport to be the only one
in the know, except your principals! What I’d like
to find out is who’s going to carry off the World’s
Series Championship!”</p>

<p>Mr. Lancaster laughed, with a friendly and admiring
look at unconscious Cis, who was laughing
at Rod’s assurance that he could tell her, only she
wouldn’t believe him. They had a bet on the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
of the baseball season, on the chances of which
they differed.</p>

<p>After dinner there was music; Mr. Lancaster
played the piano remarkably well, and Rodney had
brought his violin; he played with brilliant excellence
music that was sometimes sentimental, sometimes
frolicsome, always popular, and never classical.
Cis had a pleasant voice and sang with natural
expression and taste, but she could not be induced
to utter a note.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to sing where I can be heard,” she
explained. “Padded cell, solitary confinement for
my concert hall!” and again Mr. Lancaster laughed
at her; he evidently found her unaffected gaiety
refreshing.</p>

<p>At last the evening was at an end, and Miss Gallatin
was helping Cis into her coat preparatory to
her leaving.</p>

<p>“So it’s all settled, Miss Adair—let me call you
Cicely, will you?” said Miss Gallatin.</p>

<p>“No, but say Cis; I like it!” Cis responded to
the affection in the rugged, patient, lonely face over
her shoulder. “Yes, it’s settled! See the ring?
I’m to be married at Christmas, if you please!
My birthday.”</p>

<p>“Are you a Noël maid?” asked Miss Gallatin. “I
noticed the ring; most beautiful! Now I understand
the holly leaves and the ruby single holly
berry. A marvellous ruby, a significant and beautiful
design for a Christmas girl!”</p>

<p>“Rod made the design; he calls me Holly,” said
Cis proudly. “He’s a great Rodney!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Has he come back to the Church to thank God
for you where He should be thanked?” asked Miss
Gallatin softly. “I want to be sure of your happiness,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no, he hasn’t, Miss Gallatin!” Cis
laughed, but she spoke impatiently. “He is so good
as it is, that I’m sure he’s all right. I can’t seem
to worry over Rod!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to build your house square with its
foundation, if it’s to stand,” said Miss Gallatin.
“Dear Cis, I do hope you’ll be happy; be blessed,
which is more. I suppose it may be that you’re
to be the torch bearer, lead G. Rodney Moore to
heaven. God sees farther than we can! Did you
like Mr. Lancaster?”</p>

<p>“Who’s Mr. Lancaster? Oh, that man downstairs?
He seems all right, plays like a dream,
though I always think it is a little queer for a man
to play the piano. Isn’t he sort of religious-crazy?
All right to be a Catholic, but you can’t keep at
it all the time, as if it was a hurdy-gurdy and the
pennies would stop if you stopped grinding it!”
Cis laughed at herself, and gathered up her gloves,
ready to go.</p>

<p>“Oh, my child, can’t you see the difference between
grinding at a thing and being permeated with
it?” cried Miss Gallatin. “You don’t grind at the
thought of Rod; you feel him, you breathe him,
though you are not consciously thinking of him.
So it is with the love of God; God is, and you
exist in Him; there is nothing that is not of Him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
in all your actions and thoughts, though it may
be only that His presence is beneath it all, not
conscious every instant to your mind. Thus Anselm
Lancaster loves God.”</p>

<p>Cis stopped short in her passage to the door, and
stared silently for a moment at Hannah Gallatin.
Then she said slowly:</p>

<p>“I never stop thinking of Rod; he is ceaselessly
before my eyes; I breathe him, not air. Do you
mean to say that anyone ever feels like that to God,
to <i>God</i>, Whom you do not see, Who is—well, far
off, not part of us, just—Oh, how shall I say it?
Just <i>God</i>, heard about in church, not very well
known?”</p>

<p>“Who is ‘just God.’ You said it well, poor Cis.
Who is our Beginning, our End, in Whom ‘we live,
and move and have our being’; Saint Paul answered
you before you asked your question. I
mean that He is loved in that way by many, and
that unless you share in that love to a degree, all
other love will fail you, and life be wretched
in its course and in its end,” said Miss Gallatin
solemnly.</p>

<p>Cis stared at her for another instant, then she
turned to go.</p>

<p>“I never once thought that piety meant that,”
she said. “Yet of course God is what you say.
It’s quite nice; I never thought I liked piety much.
Perhaps if you hang on tight when you don’t get
it, God lets you get it later on. But you must
hang on awfully tight when you don’t feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
like hanging, I suppose! Well, I certainly don’t
get it now! Thanks, Miss Gallatin. And thanks
for the dinner and nice evening.”</p>

<p>On the way to Mrs. Wallace’s Rodney broke a
long silence by saying:</p>

<p>“That man was interested in you, Holly; he sat
up and took notice when you spoke.”</p>

<p>“Did he? Who did?” asked Cis, emerging from
her thoughts.</p>

<p>“Who did! How many did you meet? I’d think
you were playing off, Cis, if you ever played tricks,
off or on! That Lancaster stained-glass ecclesiastical
piece, to be sure!” retorted Rodney. “Gracious,
what a fool a man makes of himself—woman,
either!—when he or she get going on religion!
Thank the gods, we are free from humbug!
Say, Cis, how much do you love me?” Rodney
sought her hand to punctuate his question.</p>

<p>“Kids say: ‘More’n tongue can tell!’ I suspect
that’s the answer, Rory O’Moore!” said Cis.</p>

<p>“I want you to prove it, my treasure!” said Rod.
“I’ve been thinking of it for some time. I saw
when you were talking to-night of that franchise
that the matter was already decided, that you knew
which way it was going. Cis, I’d never ask you to
betray that code of your firm’s; I’d never ask you
to do a thing that was wrong, but I more than ask,
I beg of you, give me a hint, tell me whether the
franchise is going through or not. Cis, listen before
you answer! I’ll never, I swear to you, let
another person have a hint of what I know, nor
will anyone ever guess I’ve had inside information.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
I’ve a little money, a few thousands; that stock can
be bought for, say .33, brokers’ commissions and
all told. It will sell for 200 within a year, if it
goes at all. Tell me only this: Shall I take the
stock to the limit of my capital, or is it hands off?
See? I don’t ask for a word directly on the franchise,
but shall I buy or let it alone? Tell me,
Cis; it’s for us both, you know.”</p>

<p>That last appeal stiffened Cis. She cried impatiently:</p>

<p>“Do you think I want to profit by dishonor?”</p>

<p>“Cis, Cis, my Holly-bride, my wife in eight
weeks, do listen to me!” implored Rod. “It
isn’t wrong to give me the tip; I won’t let
anyone else share it; you wouldn’t be betraying
confidence, but you would share your knowledge
with your full self. You and I will be one person
months before that franchise matter is public,
likely. Only this, Cis: Shall I buy that stock, or
not? Just nod yes, or shake your head, no. Make
me by a nod, or save me by a shake of the head;
that’s all! I need money, Cis. You hesitate!
Fine old love yours is!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rod, I can’t! Don’t you see I can’t?” begged
Cis. “Don’t ask me, don’t! Mr. Lucas—they all
trust me. I never played anyone false in all my
life——”</p>

<p>“Except me!” cried Rodney bitterly. “You’re my
wife, or as good as that, with all yourself pledged
to me, yet when you can serve me, merely by a
tiny nod when I ask: ‘Cis, shall I buy that stock?’
you are stiff-necked and indifferent; you won’t by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the tiny inclination of your head help me upon my
feet! Shame, Cicely Adair! It’s not what I call
love; it’s not what I counted on in you! I thought
you’d die for me, if need were! It’s not the money,
not first! You fail me, Cis; you refuse to help
me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rod, oh, Rod!” cried Cis in torture. “You
know, you know it’s all false! I—can’t! Oh, I
will, I will! Oh, Rod, don’t look like that, not at
me; not at Cis! I’ll die for you, I will! I shall be
dead if I’m no longer trustworthy, but I’d die for
you! Buy the stock. The franchise is decided; it
is going through! Oh, Rod, Rod! Oh, what have
I done!”</p>

<p>“Right, my precious, my darling! Anyone would
say you had done right. No one will be the worse
for it, and I’ll be far, far better! We’ll be better!
Bless you, my Holly girl, my brave, true, loyal
Holly girl!” cried Rodney triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t call me loyal!” Cis gasped. “And plan so
I’ll never profit by that money. Rodney, it is heaven
to love you, but, oh, it can be hell to have anyone
so necessary to you that everything goes down before
the dread of paining him!”</p>

<p>Rodney left Cis on the steps of Mrs. Wallace’s
house, looking wan and pale, grief and terror in
her wide eyes, but he did not pity her. He was sure
that she would soon throw off what he considered
her morbid exaggeration of her failure to keep her
employers’ secret.</p>

<p>“Fancy her not telling me! The silly darling!”
Rodney thought, striding away, whistling loudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the air with which he serenaded Cis when he
passed down her street at night; he was sure that
she was still standing within the open door; listening
to his receding steps and his merry whistling.</p>

<p>“I’ve got her where I want her! Exactly where I
I want her! She’d throw over this world, and the
next, and everything in them for me! There’s not
another like her; all mad love for me, yet crystal-clear
in soul! Oh, <i>soul</i>! It’s not that; it’s her honesty,
her truth, her selflessness! I can’t seem to face
fooling her; I guess I’ll have to lay the cards on the
table in front of her, before Christmas, too! I don’t
want to fool Cis Adair! And there’s not the slightest
risk in doing it, not now! Probably there never
was. She’s no doddering slave of ignorant prejudice!
Besides, I’ve got her where I want her;
to-day proved that! Dandy good thing it happened;
tested her, gave me pluck to start in square
with her, and honesty’s the only policy with Cis,
that’s sure! Just where I want her! My splendid
girl! It hurt, but she stood pat! Conscience won’t
make a coward of brave Cis! And afterward I’ll
know how to salve the conscience if it happens to
smart a little. After Christmas I’ll be her conscience!
Just where I want her, that gorgeous Cis
of mine!”</p>

<p>Rodney went on glowing with triumph, the
haunting dread of his past weeks almost laid, and
Cis, when the last echo of his going had died away,
closed the door and went up stairs slowly, for the
first time in all her life seeking her bed with a
heavy heart.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

THE STRAINED CABLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a new element in life for Cis, a
chord in its accompaniment that jarred, though
she tried not to hear it. For the first time since she
had been old enough to deal consciously with other
people, Cis had done something in relation to another
of which she was ashamed. When she omitted
Mass on days of obligation, when it occurred to her
that her infrequency at the sacraments was not to
her credit, she was a little sorry, half resolved to do
better, but she was not ashamed; she indirectly
counted upon “fixing it up.” It is a noteworthy
fact that people who do less for God expect Him to
do more for them; they read the text: “because she
has loved little much is forgiven her.”</p>

<p>But in relation to question of honor, “dealing
straight” as she put it, Cis was acutely sensitive.
She told herself that it would be too much to expect
of anyone not to give her betrothed information
which she possessed and which would not go
farther, which would, without harm to another,
greatly benefit him. The fact which she could not
argue down as it faced her frowningly, was that Mr.
Lucas had made no exception to his prohibition
against disclosing the secret which her position
necessitated her knowing, that she had given her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
pledge to keep it—and had broken it! For the sake
of Rod, only, of course, to whom she owed her best
help, but she had broken it!</p>

<p>The knowledge that she had failed in honor for
the first time in her life shamed her, afflicted her.
And back of this shame was a more poignant pain
which she did not admit in her thoughts. It was
Rod’s pleading, his making this a test of her devotion
to him, to which she had yielded. Rod had
been indifferent to her duty when it stood in the
way of his advantage. Was Rod, could Rod be—Cis
never went farther, but that was far enough to
leave her weary in mind.</p>

<p>The visible result of her inward torment was to
make her more demonstrative of love for Rodney;
he was surprised to see in her daily new proof of its
strength, of her disregard of the reserve which, up
to this time, had tantalized him in her, while it
whetted his delight in the expressions of feeling
which he wrung from her. Now she adored him
openly, frankly, with a feverish eagerness which he
might have correctly construed if his understanding
of this type of girl had been more profound.
He thought it was due to the rapidly nearing date of
their marriage, and it made his head swim to think
what Cis would be to him in her own home if the
approach to its threshold so multiplied her sweet
ways.</p>

<p>A letter had come to Cis from Nan in reply to
hers announcing her marriage on Christmas eve, a
Nan-like letter, full of love for Cis, but no less full
of anxiety. “It seems so quick, Cis darling!” Nan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
wrote. “To think that you’ll be married before
me, and I’ve known Joe almost all my life! You
have not said that your Rod is a Catholic, but Moore
is sometimes Irish, so I suppose he is one. You
would not marry anyone who was not a Catholic?
We’ve so often decided that it is madness to set out
on a certainty that there’ll be something serious to
differ upon, when it’s so hard, at best, for people to
grow close together, so easy to differ. Besides, it’s
wrong; for the children’s sake it’s wrong—but you
always said that yourself, so I’m sure Rod Moore
is a good Catholic. Dearest Cis, I never could tell
you how I hope and pray for you! For I’m always
fonder of you than of any other friend I have. Lovingly,
Your same old, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what she’d say if she knew Rod had
been a Catholic and given it up? Nan would far
rather he’d always been Protestant, of course; it
would be better, too. Wonder what in all the
world she’d say if she knew he was determined to
get me to give it all up myself? Nan would take
the first train on here, carrying a big jug of Holy
Water, and she’d simply souse Rod and me to drive
off the devil—bless her heart! But I’m not going
to quit. To be sure I did miss Mass last Sunday,
but I go pretty regularly; I’ll go every Sunday after
I’m married, because it will be up to me to set a
good example, bring Rod back. A person must
have some religion, and it’s silly to have one made
by Luther, or Henry the Eighth, or someone; I
could make one myself as well as that bunch! I
suppose it would be easier to convert a Protestant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
than turn Rod back; he’s awfully down on it,
really! I wonder why? That’s not like being slack
and lazy-minded! ‘For the children’s sake,’ Nan
says! Well, I hope I’ll have children, certainly,
but I’m not going to marry to please them, I’ll tell
them that right now! They’ll have to take what
they find, and if they’ll grow up as splendid as
Rod is, Church or no Church, I’ll be proud of
them! Funny little Nannie!”</p>

<p>“Rory O’Moore,” Cis said that evening to Rodney,
“I’ve got to ’fess to Mr. Lucas!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to do nothing of the sort!” Rod
angrily exclaimed. “Cis, don’t be an idiot! What
good would it do? Could you take back what
you told me? You’d be a miserable sinner if you
would, provided you could! Mr. Lucas is happy
while he is ignorant; let him alone in that form of
bliss! No harm is done, nobody wronged, nobody
the wiser. What good would you do by telling on
yourself? All you’d do is to mess up the situation.
You’ll be married and out of the office soon. My
wife isn’t going to keep on in business! Thanks to
your tip, my dearest, we’ll have a nice little increase
to our income.”</p>

<p>“I can’t answer one of your common-sense statements,
Rod,” said Cis slowly, “but I can’t go along
with them. Mr. Lucas thinks what isn’t true. Truth
is the only basis for dealing with anyone. I’ve got
to tell him exactly what I did; I can’t breathe in his
office while I know that when he looks at me he sees
what isn’t there. I don’t care to own up, Rod dear,
but when there isn’t solid rock-bottom of truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
under my dealings, my relations with a person, I
feel like that Irishman who didn’t like aeroplanes
because ‘when they stopped there wasn’t any place
to stand to crank the thing!’ When someone is deceived
in you, if you don’t make it straight, it’s
worse than playing with ghosts—they touch you
and you touch them, yet neither of you is there at
all!”</p>

<p>Rodney looked at Cicely for a long time, an inscrutable
expression upon his face. She made a
little grimace at him, twisting her lips and showing
her dimple, but he did not respond with a smile.
She thought that he was displeased with her, and
again coaxed him with pursed-up lips, but Rodney’s
eyes were steady, clouded; he looked bothered,
plainly was deep in thought.</p>

<p>“I’ll put off telling, Rory O’Moore,” Cis said,
misunderstanding him. “If you hate to have me
tell, I won’t tell right away, but I’ve got to tell
sometime, please, Rod!”</p>

<p>It was a week later that Rod said to Cis: “Will
you come with me to the apartment to-morrow,
Holly? I’ve had sent in a few odd chairs, and a
table that hit me exactly where I live, and I’d like
your opinion of them, Mistress-of-the-Mansion-elect!”
They had agreed to pick out the furnishings
of their home together, but Cis looked delighted
at this departure from the bargain on Rodney’s
part, and gladly said that she would go with
him to see his selections.</p>

<p>They had changed rôles for the week that had
just passed; Cis, relieved by her definitely announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
plan to confess her wrong-doing to Mr.
Lucas, felt better about it, and had been bubbling
over with fun and high spirits. Rodney, on the
contrary, had been cast-down; Cis repeatedly
caught him looking at her with such a sober and
apprehensive look, that she had once been moved
to expostulate with him.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, Rory O’Moore,” she cried,
“stop looking at me as if you were saying: ‘Doesn’t
she look natural! Poor thing, she was so young,
and with all her faults I love her still! Not so still
as this, though!’ I’m not nearly as dead as I might
be; in fact I’m quite lively, I think. What’s wrong
with me—or you—old chap?”</p>

<p>“I’m deciding something, Holly-berry,” Rodney
answered, not smiling at her nonsense. “I’m wondering
what you’d want me to do about a certain
thing, on which I can’t consult you without giving
the thing away, so you never would have a chance to
decide it, after all. Sounds mysterious, but it’s the
best I can do by way of answering you. I’m wondering
how you’d react under something I’ve a
mind to do. You’re the frankest human being I
ever knew, Cis; you never have hidden meanings,
nor lay a plot; you act outright and talk right out!
Yet I’m not one bit sure of what you’d do under
untried conditions; you’re capable of doing one of
two completely opposite things.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cis lightly, in too contented a
frame of mind to pay close attention to what Rodney
might be implying, “I’m glad you can’t tell
which way I’d jump. Sounds quite impressive, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
probably it’s something like whether I’d go back on
my bronzey little library and go in for red, after I’d
sworn no red should come into my happy home!
I’m more interesting if I’m uncertain; that’s why
you like women, you men, my Rory; they keep you
guessing! I’m dreadfully afraid you do know all I
think, and what I’d do, but it’s dear of you to pretend
I’m a nice sphinxy-sphynx!”</p>

<p>Rodney laughed; he had instantly regretted
speaking as he had spoken, and he was glad that
Cis’s incorrigible light-heartedness prevented her
from taking him seriously, gave him longer to decide
whether he should pursue his original plan,
and tell Cis the secret which he meant to tell her
after their marriage, or put himself at her mercy
by telling her at once. He knew that this was the
only honorable course; he knew that, if their places
were reversed, Cis would deal thus with him.</p>

<p>It was the last Sunday in November, the first
Sunday in Advent, and Cis and Rodney were happily
on their way to look at the three chairs of unusual
design, and the beautiful mahogany table
which, so Rodney delighted to put it to Cis, he “had
sent home.”</p>

<p>The day enveloped them with the caresses of
Saint Martin’s Summer; warm sunshine; gentle air
that brushed over them as they walked, like wings
that bore blessings; a cloudless sky, veiled with
hazy warmth that softened, yet did not conceal the
bright blue that stretched from horizon to horizon.</p>

<p>“The winter of our discontent is turned glorious
summer by our sunny walk,” said Rodney, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
an attempt to retain the sound and not the sense of
the quotation which was lost on Cis. “Almost December
first, only two days distant, and even this
light-weight overcoat a burden! It’s what my grandmother
used to call a weather-breeder.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why people want to take the polish
off of a day like this!” cried Cis. “A day like this is a
present from heaven, and I don’t like to look a gift
horse in the mouth. Rory O’Moore, don’t you
think it came just to rejoice with us and strew our
path to our new little home?”</p>

<p>“Like a wedding flower girl? Oh, Cicely, you
bride of brides! I’d think any day would smile and
look pleasant when it came up at dawn to find us
together,” Rodney spoke with a little laugh in his
voice, but it trembled too.</p>

<p>The apartment did not include many rooms, but
they were—for apartment rooms—spacious. There
were two excellent bedrooms, a small room for the
maid, and its accompanying bath at the rear, a
small kitchen, a pretty dining room, and a really
fine living room, besides a tiled bathroom which
was so white, so modern and perfect in its appointments
that Cis found herself unexpectedly housewifely
every time that she saw it. Mentally she
screwed bright nickle fixtures upon the slabs built
in for them, and hung heavily initialled towels
upon glass rods, as she stood in the doorway, taking
in the details of this room devoted to the practice
of the virtue which is next to godliness.</p>

<p>“I’m going to turn out well, Rory O’Moore!” Cis
announced, swinging around to face Rodney, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
had come up behind her and placed his hands upon
her shoulders. “You always knew I’d be agreeable
to have around, but you never dreamed I’d be a
real, dyed-in-the-wool domestic character! Neither
did I, but I shall be; I feel it coming on! I yearn
to scrub this white floor and polish the faucets!
The kitchen, with that white sink and draining
board, and the cunning cupboard, goes to my head
till it fairly spins with rapture! Oh, Rod, it’s the
sweetness of doing for you! I’ve been half scared
to be married, even to you, but this apartment takes
it all out of me! It’s home and home-making; it’s
living for, and with, and in each other! Oh, my
Rod, I’m not afraid, I’m <i>not</i>! I’m glad, <i>glad</i> I’m
coming here to be with you, and scrub <i>your</i> rooms,
and wash <i>your</i> dishes!”</p>

<p>“Holly, my blessed Holly!” Rodney breathed the
words almost inaudibly into Cicely’s ear, all that
was fine in him moved and awed before her sweetness.</p>

<p>Voluntarily Cis threw her arms around his neck
and kissed him, and caresses were rare with her,
yielded only to his implorations. Rodney understood
that she was betrothing herself anew, and he
met her spirit in tune with it. Why did he fear to
tell her his secret? This rare, deep-hearted Cicely
would not fail him for a chimera!</p>

<p>The new table awakened little less than rapture
in Cis; it was exactly to her mind. The three chairs
no less; deep-seated, low, at once “impressive and
home chairs,” Cis pronounced them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Suppose we use them for awhile, Cicely dear,”
Rodney proposed. “I’d like to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’m ready to talk, or to listen,” agreed
Cis, dropping into the chair which she had at once
pronounced “made for the lady of the house.”
“Sounds queer to hear you call me Cicely, Rodney!”
she added, laughing at him.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to learn to call you that in case we
ever have company,” returned Rodney. “See, here,
Cis, I sort of dread to say what I’m going to say;
please help me to it. I thought I’d tell you after
we were married, but you’re so keen to have things
clear between you and Mr. Lucas, you’re so straight,
I thought—Cis, if you were anyone else, anything
else but what you are, I’d follow my own judgment,
but you’re so crystal-clear—Cis, try to understand,
and for pity’s sake don’t be prejudiced—There’s
no sense in building up false theories of life—”</p>

<p>Cicely was sitting erect and still, her lips parted,
her very muscles eloquent of tensity of mind.</p>

<p>“What are you stumbling over, Rod? What are
you going to tell me?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“When I talked to you about my life, told you
about it, you did not notice that I said nothing
about three years of it, when I was in Chicago,”
said Rodney.</p>

<p>Cis shook her head, groping backward in her
memory to recall what he had said.</p>

<p>“Only that you were there for three years; that’s
all I remember,” she said.</p>

<p>“How do you feel about second marriages, Cis?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
asked Rodney. “Would you hate to be a second
wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Cis gasped, and sank back in her chair.</p>

<p>“It’s not—not so nice,” she said hesitatingly.
“To think you were married, actually married,
fixed up a home before this one, brought a girl into
it, loved her—Oh, Rod, were you? Were you—married—before?”</p>

<p>Rodney nodded. “Yes, Cis, I was. I had to tell
you; please, please, don’t mind, Cis!”</p>

<p>For a few minutes Cicely was silent, shading her
face with her hand; Rodney waited breathlessly for
her to speak.</p>

<p>At last she pushed back her hair with the hand
that had rested against her forehead, smiled
bravely, with a visible effort, and put out that hand
to Rodney.</p>

<p>“Poor dear!” she said softly. “I’m sorry! It
rather knocked me up at first, but I won’t let it
bother me long. All girls like to be the first, you
know, but it’s really all right, as long as you love
me dearly now. You told me that you’d fancied
others before me, so I did half-way know, but marriage
is different. I didn’t know you’d loved one
well enough for that. I wish you’d told me sooner—But
it was awfully hard to tell me at all, I see
that, so I’m grateful to you for making yourself
speak of it now. It is right to have told me before
we were married; I don’t know just how I should
have felt if I’d found it out later; I’m so keen on
honesty.”</p>

<p>Rodney winced. “I know, Cis; that’s why I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
to tell you. But that time was nothing like this;
don’t you imagine I ever felt for any other girl what
I feel for you!”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor Other Girl!” murmured Cis. “I don’t
like to have you say what she would have hated!
Better let me be a little bit sore, because I’ll fight it
down, and I’m alive, and it’s like taking an advantage
of a dead girl to say what you did. Do you
mind talking of her, Rodney dear? Would you tell
me about her? Does it hurt to speak of her? What
did she look like? Dark hair and eyes, because
mine are not. Was she little and sweet, or tall and
splendid? Rod, oh, my poor Rod, you suffered,
you must have suffered when she—died! And I
could not be there to help you! I’d have helped
you, dear. Will you tell me all these things? Can
you bear it? Does it still hurt, Rod? If it does,
oh, if it does, then this is not altogether my home!
It is part hers, and so are you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care any more for her, Cicely Adair,
than I care for your friend Nan’s cat—if she has
one! Don’t you get notions! It was a mad infatuation;
I might have known how she’d have turned
out, but I was young, and—well, Cis, I got all
snarled up with her. That’s not much like my love
for you!” Rodney cried.</p>

<p>“Oh me, oh dear!” Cis half sobbed. “I don’t
know whether that makes it better; I’ve got to get
used to this, and go off to think it out by myself.
When did she die? Where did you bury her?”</p>

<p>“In the Chicago divorce court,” said Rodney savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“In—the—” Cis stopped short, her eyes dilated,
staring at Rodney, her hands clasping the arms of
“the lady of the house’s chair.” “Rodney Moore,
she is not dead? She is alive? You—you!—have
a living wife?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no! Not yet, not yet, Holly! At Christmas
I’ll have,” cried Rodney springing to his feet.
“I am free, free as you are, <i>free</i>! I’m not married!
I divorced her; she was as bad as they come, and
I’m freed by my decree to marry. I’m no more
married than you are.” He took a step toward her,
but Cis held out both hands, warding him off.</p>

<p>“She is alive. Don’t touch me!” she cried. “She
is alive. No decree kills her; your wife is alive,”
she gasped.</p>

<p>“Cis, listen to me!” Rodney began, dropping on
his knees beside Cicely, compelling her horror-stricken
eyes to meet his eyes. “That girl was not
fit to be any man’s wife. Do you understand? My
marriage was a mockery from the first, and soon I
hated her as much as I had been fascinated by her.
From sly, hidden beginnings, she soon passed into
open evil. She disgraced me while I was her husband,
and since I have been free of her she has gone
into utter degradation. There was not an instant’s
question of my getting rid of her; court and common
humanity would grant me my decree of divorce.
Are you going to tell me that I have a living
wife? I have no wife. Would you make all my
life desolate because she was what she was? Only
the Catholic Church forbids marriage under my
conditions. Do you see now why I want you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
shake off her laws, which do violence to every
natural instinct of justice? Am I to suffer, live
alone, denied wife and children? <i>I</i> suffer, who
was not the offender? Is that sense? Plain common
sense forbids such foolishness. Throw off
your prejudices; come out into freedom and happiness,
my darling! Only your ridiculous Roman
Catholic tyrants forbid it; God is on our side, not
they! The reverend mayor, or a reverend alderman
can marry us as tight and as sacredly as that
thin Jesuit can whom we met coming back from
Pioneer Falls that Sunday. You’re not actually a
Catholic. Cis, I’ve suffered enough. Make it up to
me! With you my wife there won’t be a scar left of
these wicked wounds! Cis, don’t you love me?
Stop staring at me so, as if you’d never seen me
before! Cis, don’t you know I’m Rory O’Moore,
unchanged? That this is our home, and you my
Holly-bride?”</p>

<p>Cis did not move. She stared at Rodney stonily,
trying to force her mind to grasp this thing that had
fallen upon her when her happiness was at its
height, made sweeter and holier than before by her
new sense of the meaning of home-making.</p>

<p>“Was this woman—your wife—was she a Catholic?”
Cis managed to ask.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve no love for the Catholic Church, but
I wouldn’t wish her on any Church,” Rodney
laughed bitterly. “Religion wasn’t in her line, but
her people were Catholic; she’d had baptism.”</p>

<p>“You knew that, because you were married by a
priest,” Cicely groped in her mind for what she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
wanted to say. “They ask—about baptism. You
were married by a priest?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, good heavens, Cis—” Rodney cried
out. “What of that? These things have no power
over us unless we give them the right to it. Priest
or no priest, the laws of our country freed me; isn’t
that enough?”</p>

<p>“You have a living wife.” Cis repeated the
words, changing her formula, but clinging to the
sole idea that took shape in her stunned brain.</p>

<p>“Cicely, Cis, my Holly, don’t, don’t, for the love
of justice, for the love of me, benumb yourself with
such idiocy! I have no wife! Cis, listen! <i>I—have—no—wife!</i>
Will you leave me?” Rodney cried,
leaping to his feet, for Cis had risen. “You can’t!
Throw over the Church! Come to me! You love
me; I worship you. I need you. Cis, are you utterly
heartless? Church or me, and you hesitate!
Me, your husband! Oh, Cis, look at this home of
ours; stay in it!”</p>

<p>Cis lifted both arms toward heaven with a great,
tragic gesture, and turned in silence toward the
door. Rodney leaped to reach it before her, but
she raised her hand and looked at him. Her
blanched face, surmounted by her glowing hair was
deathlike and awful; it made Rodney fall back to
let her pass, afraid to check her.</p>

<p>“I will go away to think. I can’t think now. I
will send you word when I know. I may come
back. I cannot think. You have killed my brain.
I don’t know—but you have a living wife! I will
go away to think. Let me go, alone. I must go—alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
There is not even Cis Adair left to go with
me. How strange to come alive and go out dead!
Your wife is alive. Good-bye. Let me pass.”</p>

<p>Cis spoke slowly, with great difficulty, yet clearly,
and Rodney, awed and conscience-stricken to see
her thus, fell back and let her go. Afterward he
marvelled that he had done so, and cursed his folly,
but under the spell of Cicely’s eyes he could not do
otherwise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

DARKNESS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CICELY came out into the golden weather of that
belated St. Martin’s Summer day which she
had said had been sent to bless her path to her new
home. The sunshine was as warm, the air as soft,
the sky as beautifully blue as when she had crossed
the threshold of her paradise, from which horror
and her stumbling conscience were driving her, but
she saw nothing of the beauty around her.</p>

<p>Shut into her own mind, she walked unseeing,
unaware, the interior darkness not lifting even so
much as to reveal to her what and why she suffered.
Or did she suffer? Something had happened to
her; everything was obliterated; pain was not conscious
to her, nor loss, but in a vacuum that forbade
breath, in a pit without ray or exit, she walked the
Beaconhite streets, not knowing where she went,
nor whom she passed. Something repeated ceaselessly:
“A wife. A wife, alive; he has a wife. He
is married.” She did not know why she so insisted
upon this; it tired her, and many men had a wife.
Who was it that had one whose having one so mattered
to her?</p>

<p>She could not think; she must think. That was it;
she must think. Never before had she felt the need
of thinking, but there was something that she must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
think out. What it was, or why she must think
about it, she could not tell, but the immediate,
pressing necessity was to think; she must find a
place to think in. Not her own room at Mrs. Wallace’s;
she would not go there. The park? That
might do, though she would like to go where no one
could come near her, and the park would be full of
strollers on such a Sunday as this. Solitude, a place
to think, to gather up vague horrors which were
lurking at the back of her brain, waiting to be assembled
into definite agony. Cis dimly felt that
agony was upon her, beginning, yet almost it would
be better than this strange bewilderment which
held for her but two cogent impressions. They rose
up out of her chaos like spars of a shipwreck:
Someone, Rodney Moore—but she could not quite
grasp who Rodney Moore was, why his affairs
affected her—had a living wife. And she must find
solitude and think; there was something that she
must clearly see, upon which she must decide.</p>

<p>She turned the corner of a street, going on aimlessly.
The church had not occurred to her as a
quiet place in which she could think, still less did it
occur to poor Cicely, who had few of the habits of
devotion, to seek the church for enlightenment,
guidance, strength. She had never formed the custom
of making visits to the church, so now, bewildered,
benumbed, there was no deep-seated instinct
to lead her thither when her brain was not directing
her steps. Yet before her, as she came down
this street into which she had turned, stood the
church of St. Francis Xavier, the church to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
she repaired nearly every week for her compulsory
Mass of Sunday.</p>

<p>“That ought to be a quiet place,” Cis told herself,
and ascended the church steps. It was a large
church, fine in architecture, not tasteful in decoration.
It was much too strong-colored, too bizarre in
the designs of its interior, yet it contrived to get an
effect of splendor, in spite of its offenses against the
canons of art, and it needed no contriving to give an
instant sense of cheerfulness, of homelikeness, of
kindness, and, withal, of devotion to those who entered
it.</p>

<p>There were but few people in it at this hour,
when dinner and the companionship of the weekly
holiday occupied most of its frequenters. Those
who were there were kneeling at the farther end of
the deep building, before the shrine of Our Lady
of Lourdes, or the Sacred Heart altar, or before the
Pietà that stood near the sanctuary rail, just within
it. A half dozen, or less, knelt before the candelabrum
which held the votive candles; they had each
lighted one, and were praying raptly that the boon
which they implored by whispered prayer and representative
little candle might be granted.</p>

<p>Cis went into a pew close to the door, and from
habit, but without consciousness of her action, knelt
and made the sign of the cross because she had just
come into church. She had long ago fallen into the
way of thus kneeling on entering, and, first of all
prayers, repeating the Act of Contrition.</p>

<p>Now she began slowly, without knowing what she
said, to whisper: “In the Name of the Father, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. O my God, I
am heartily sorry that—” Her lips ceased moving;
she could go no farther. Heartily sorry—for what?</p>

<p>Rodney Moore had a living wife; he was unhappy
about it. So was she. She was sorry that
this was so. There was that nice apartment which
he had shown her, and those chairs; one was the
chair for the lady of the house. What hurt her so?
Was it her head? It did not seem to her that she
had brought it with her, yet she felt a terrible pain;
it seemed to be in her head. What was it she had to
think about? Rodney was not dead. Why did she
feel as though he were dead? Or was it that there
was no Rodney? He had a wife, alive. He had
none, so he had said, but if she were alive? He
must have forgotten, poor Rodney, that when one’s
wife is alive—there she is: alive! Still the wife.
She was not thinking, and she had come here to
think; it was quiet, deeply, peacefully quiet, and
somehow quieting, as well. She would be able to
think here.</p>

<p>Cis knelt staring at the altar, her face so white
that an old woman, entering, turned as if to speak
to her, then changed her mind and went on, shaking
her head pityingly, saying to herself: “God pity
and help her, the poor young creature!” as she
ducked her edition of a genuflection toward the altar
and knelt in a pew, rattling big brown rosary
beads, supplemented by several large medals, on
the back of the pew against which she rested her
gnarled hands.</p>

<p>Was it that the benison was effective? It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
long before the strange submergence of her conscious
self which had overwhelmed Cicely on hearing
Rodney’s knell of her joy, broke and rolled
back, leaving her soul bare to an agony that saw
only too clearly, grasped only too acutely exactly
what had befallen her.</p>

<p>She was promised to marry within four weeks a
man whose wife was still alive!</p>

<p>Under the law of the country Rodney was entirely
free. It was the woman, not he, who had
broken the marriage vow, who had desecrated the
marriage, sinned against herself, against Rodney,
against God. No one would ask a man to condone
her sin, unrepented, persisted in. The state issued
licenses to marry; it protected the legality of marriage;
under its laws children were made legitimate,
their rights protected; marriage was a civil
institution, the foundation of decent living, of
homes which were the unit of the state; it was essentially
the bulwark of civilization. When it
ceased to be the foundation of decent living, when
the sin of a parent endangered the legitimacy of
children, when the home was corrupted, the yoke
become a galling chain, even disgrace, then the
state, which had approved the union and licensed
it under its laws, revoked it, dissolved it, allowing
the innocent partner of the union to go free, to
make another marriage if he, or she, so desired; be
perfectly free to enjoy the rights of every citizen,
“life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>

<p>If there were states which went so far as to allow
equal privileges to the guilty spouse; which gave to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
one who had debased one marriage, freedom to contract
another, or even others, that was all wrong, of
course, but that consideration was uncalled for in
this case. Rodney was wronged; he had been made
free of the person who had wrecked his happiness,
and that was just.</p>

<p>Ah, but what was this, this other side to the
divorce question? The teaching of Christ Himself,
of His Church, continuing His teaching, practising
it, though it bore ever so heavily upon a case peculiarly
putting forth pleas for its exception; holding
it irrefrangible though it cost a kingdom, and
plunged a whole noble and religious nation into
heresy?</p>

<p>Cicely’s mind was as keenly awake now as it had
been benumbed at first. Teaching that she had
heard without realization of hearing it, came to life,
stored up within that memory which is one of the
soul’s component parts.</p>

<p>The Church’s laws were not flexible on fundamental
questions; they were made for all, and
whether they were brought to bear upon a case
which seemed to deserve the severity of their full
application, or whether—as now—they seemed too
cruel, they admitted no indulgence. Rodney Moore
had married a girl who was baptized in the Catholic
Church, as was he. He had married unwisely, from
unworthy motives, but that did not lessen the guilt
of the wife who had betrayed him. The Church
would not insist that the union of marriage be
maintained in such a case as this, but Rodney and
his wife had spoken the vow which precludes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
taking of another man or woman in espousal till
death has ended the duration of that vow. The
state could annul the civil marriage which it had
made, but far beyond its province lay the sacramental
marriage, so far beyond it that not even the
Church, with its divinely delegated authority to
bind and to loose could annul a marriage to which
there was no impediment according to her laws;
performed by her authority under God; vowed to
God directly; sealed by her sacramental seal which
cannot be broken till death has broken it.</p>

<p>This knowledge of the Church’s position as to
marriage came clearly before Cicely’s mind as she
knelt, her eyes fixed upon the altar, which she did
not see. With such vivid remembrance of what she
had been taught by sermons, by reading, by acquaintance
with Catholics like the Dowling family,
whose talk on divorce she had heard and shared,
for it is a subject that no modern American can escape,
Cis marshalled the facts of the Catholic
Church’s attitude toward divorce. She had heard
words which returned to her, and she knew who it
was that had uttered them. “For this cause shall a
man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his
wife; and they two shall be as one flesh. And he
that shall marry her that is put away committeth
adultery.”</p>

<p>Strange that she should remember this! Cis wondered
at it; she could not ordinarily repeat texts.
There was no divorce, not within the Church. Cicely
knew now why she had repeated wearily those horrible
words: “He has a living wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Rodney had a living wife, and while she lived
Cicely Adair could not be his wife, however wicked
his wife had been—not in the eyes of the Catholic
Church!</p>

<p>There was the crux of the matter. In the eyes of
the state, of the average American society, Cicely
Adair, and still another after her, might be Rodney
Moore’s wife for all his first misadventure!</p>

<p>Rodney implored her to come out of the Church
into freedom. Ah, yes, and more, far, far more—into
his arms, into his home, into that lovable,
cheery, blessed little apartment waiting for them!</p>

<p>She had but to go to him, tell him that she was
ready, that she would leave all to follow him—She
checked herself; even in her thoughts she could not
travesty the divine words which related to marriage,
but to the sacrament of marriage. Not to leave
Him did Our Lord bid His followers leave all to
cling to a wife, but rather to come after Him and,
thus coming, derive strength to cleave to one spouse
in a union transcending the weakness of nature.</p>

<p>Back upon its track Cicely’s mind travelled,
leaving the thought of Our Lord’s teaching. Rodney
bade her prove her love for him. He had reminded
her of how indifferent a Catholic she was.
It was true. She rarely thought about her faith; it
did not form an integral, vital part of her days. She
kept to it, but she did not enjoy it, nor did she often
draw near to its heart, nor know much about its devotions,
live in its calendar year. She dimly knew
that some people did these things; Nan came nearer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
to it than Cis realized, she imagined, but as a rule
these things seemed to be fit for nuns.</p>

<p>She need never take a definite step, like renouncing
her faith overtly. All that she had to do was to
marry Rodney. She would have to be married by a
civil officer, or a minister; no priest could marry
her, of course, and that would put her outside the
Church. After that she would go into her own
home, and live her life of complete devotion to
Rodney. If she had children she would widen out
to embrace them in her heart, but Rodney first!
Always, always Rodney first! She—they—could
teach their children to be upright, kind, good citizens,
good moral men and women. Rodney said it
was ridiculous to delude yourself into thinking that
more than this was needed, or that anyone really
knew anything more about life and death than that
a man must live in the world decently, and then
when he died, if there was anything more for him,
he’d be sure to get the good coming to him, because
he had not made the world a worse place for anyone
else. And if there were nothing beyond but a
long, dreamless sleep, and pretty flowers springing
out of your ashes—well! Then that’s all there was
of it, and you would have played your part creditably
and gone out leaving an honored name.</p>

<p>Cecily saw Rod’s handsome, laughing face in her
memory as it had looked when he had said this, and
she heard his jolly, infectious laugh! Oh, how she
wanted him, <i>wanted</i> him! The longing for him
swept over her like physical sickness, and she shuddered,
turning cold. She had left him miserable;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
she had deserted him. Deserted him in the home
he was making for her; she was wrecking his home
a second time as that other woman had wrecked his
first home. She, Cis, was respectable in the eyes of
the world, and that other was not, but was she any
better than the outcast?</p>

<p>Cicely raised her ring to her lips and kissed over
and over again its glowing ruby. “The color of her
love, of the warm blood of her great heart,” Rod
had told her the ruby was. And she had been cold-hearted
toward him, had failed him when he trusted
her. He might have deceived her, have married
her and not told her till afterward. How splendid
he was to be truthful, honorable toward her!
Should she punish him for his virtues? Even a
child is told that if it tells the truth it shall not be
punished, but how cruelly, how wickedly she was
punishing Rod, Rory O’Moore!</p>

<p>She would go to him and beg his forgiveness; he
would forgive her, remembering that she, too, had
suffered, that his secret had shocked her beyond the
power to think at first; Rod was always big, and
kind.</p>

<p>She would marry him. Even though a magistrate
married her and by so doing expelled her
from Catholic communion she would marry him.
Excommunicated! It did sound fearful! But words
did not matter! She would not strike Rodney in
the face, drive him from her with a blow upon his
heart!</p>

<p>Cicely’s eyes, fixed upon the altar, unseeing, their
gaze turned inward, suddenly saw. Her gaze turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
outward, and she saw the small golden door upon
which her set eyes had been resting, saw it, and saw
the crucifix above it, a tall, vivid crucifix over the
tabernacle door, under the tabernacle dome. And
suddenly Cicely began to tremble violently and her
icy hands clutched at the back of the pew before
her.</p>

<p>Who, then, would she strike in the Face? Upon
Whose Sacred Heart would she deal the blow which
drove Him from her?</p>

<p>Never again should she see that golden door open
and her Lord come forth to her. Never again would
a priest turn to her and bid her “Behold the Lamb
of God.” Seldom, ah, seldom did she let the words
be addressed to her now, but—never again? Excommunicated?</p>

<p>She was a poor Catholic, cold, indifferent, ignorant,
but she was a Catholic. She had held to her
Faith, after a fashion, and she had known that she
could never substitute another faith for it. For
Rodney’s sake she would leave it, go to him, go
from God! She would heal Rodney’s wounds, but
she would join the rabble in the Garden, and betray
her Lord! She would not kiss Him, as Judas had
kissed Him, but she would kiss in bridal kiss the
man whose acceptance meant her Lord’s rejection.</p>

<p>Rodney, or her Lord? One or the other; never
both. She had not thought just what it meant, this
decision which she had reached upon a flood of
human longing and love. She wanted Rodney. She
craved for him as the body craves for food, the
parched throat for water; she agonized remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
his present pain, that she had inflicted it in return
for his honorable dealing with her.</p>

<p>But now—she saw the Tabernacle. With her
soul she saw it, and she felt by prescience the desolation
of the closing of its door, sealed by her own
action. To be an outcast, excommunicated!</p>

<p>Her mind, her torture could go no farther. In
that throe her soul was born, but she could endure
no more.</p>

<p>How long she had knelt in the church she had no
idea; she took no cognizance of her body, of its
strained position upon the knees on the narrow
kneeling-rest. It was growing dusk in the church;
she must have been there long. There were more
people moving up and down the aisles, and before
the shrines; several were making the stations, some
coming down the middle aisle, others going toward
the high altar. Cicely saw none of these.</p>

<p>She swayed on her tired knees, her aching spine
no longer supporting her, and she crumpled up
sidewise, falling over the back of the pew upon
which her arms had rested, her head upon them in
such wise that no one noticed that she had fainted.
Father Morley had come out through the sanctuary,
into the church, summoned by the little electric
bell, its button placed under the rail, near the votive-lights
candelabrum. It called a priest of that
Community to hear a confession when a priest was
needed at another time than the regular days and
hours upon which confessions were heard.</p>

<p>A man had gone into the confessional when
Father Morley took his place in the centre, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
kissed and assumed the narrow stole which had
hung across the door. The penitent took long, so
long that some of the pious women kneeling at the
side altars were interested in his case, and watched
to see him emerge, speculating on the nature of his
story; some of them said a little prayer for him that
he would “come out all right,” for good women are
always intensely interested in the reform of a possibly
bad man.</p>

<p>At last the absolution had been given, the penitent
lingered for a final question or two and Father
Morley’s answers, then he departed to say his penance
and pray his prayers before the great Pietà—which
the interested pious women thought symptomatic.</p>

<p>Father Morley folded his narrow stole, hung it
again on the confessional door, and came out, closing
the low door carefully and noiselessly behind
him. He came down the fast darkening church,
walking with his long, easy stride, peering into the
pews as he passed with his near-sighted gaze, looking
vainly for a small book which he had lent to
someone, and which that someone had telephoned
him to say that she had left in a pew in the main
aisle of the church, instead of returning it to the
lay-brother at the house door, as she had set out to
do.</p>

<p>Thus Father Morley came up to Cicely as she lay,
fallen over the pew back, held up from a complete
fall by her arms across the back of the pew in front
of her, and her back wedged against the pew in
which she had knelt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“My daughter, are you ill?” asked the priest,
pausing at Cicely’s side. As she did not answer,
nor move, he bent down and touched her. Then
he looked startled and turned her face toward him,
lifting her slightly as he did so. “Cicely Adair!”
he exclaimed aloud, instantly recognizing her, and
remembering the name which she had given him.
“My child, can you hear me? Are you ill?”</p>

<p>The easing of her position, her raised head,
brought Cicely to part consciousness. With the help
of Father Morley’s hands, supporting her beneath
her arms, she got upon her feet, looking at him
dazed, white, staring.</p>

<p>“Come out into the air, my dear,” said the Jesuit
gently. “You are suffering. It is not bodily sickness,
my poor girl! Let me help you out. Here,
my hand under your elbow, so! That’s better. Now
slowly; courage! Come into the pure, good air,
Cicely Adair!”</p>

<p>He led Cicely slowly and carefully out of the
church, down the steps, through a small gate beside
them, into a grassy yard.</p>

<p>“This is not cloister,” Father Morley said. “Our
parochial school children’s playground. Sit here,
my child, on this bench. There is a bell; I’ll ring
for Brother Feely to bring you a cup of coffee and a
few biscuits. Don’t try to speak; you can tell me
what you will later.”</p>

<p>A lay-brother with a pale, patient face, and hair
as red as Cicely’s own, came in response to Father
Morley’s call, and quickly returned with a cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
the steaming beverage, and a few thin sweet biscuits
on a plain white plate.</p>

<p>“Sip this, my daughter,” said the Jesuit, with his
benignant smile; “you are exhausted.”</p>

<p>Cicely gratefully drank of the coffee, and revived
as it coursed through her chilled body. She sat up
after she had eaten and drank, and tried to smile at
the priest. “You are very kind, Father Morley,”
she said. “I must go. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Without giving me something in return?”
hinted Father Morley. “Aren’t you going to give
me a wee bit of your confidence? What has gone
wrong with you, my child?”</p>

<p>Cicely looked long into the steady, keen, sad,
kindly eyes looking down into hers. She did not
want to speak, but, characteristically, spoke the
truth when she felt compelled to speak.</p>

<p>“I’m shocked by what I’ve found out to-day,” she
said. “I’ve got to decide something. I may leave
the Church; I don’t know. It’s that, or hurt someone
dearer to me than my life.”</p>

<p>She waited for an explosion of protest from the
Jesuit, but none came. Instead he said quietly:
“Not much comparison, is there, between hurting
a human being, and losing Almighty God, betraying
your Master and damning your soul! But no one
should decide a great matter hastily; you’ve felt
this is the greatest of great matters, I see. That’s
something. You couldn’t marry a man who had a
living wife; all your decent Catholic womanhood,
as well as your religion, is against it.”</p>

<p>Cicely sprang to her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“Father Morley, how could you know?” she
gasped.</p>

<p>“Not hard to guess. I’ve been a priest, hearing
confessions these twenty-five years, my child. Only
an insuperable obstacle to your marriage could
present to you the alternative you described. You
never will call yourself any man’s wife, when you
know you are not a wife,” replied Father Morley.
“But this is no time to talk; you’re tired, and I
dine in a short time. Think of it over night; ‘the
night brings counsel,’ and pray to the Holy Spirit.
You’ll not go home to your lonely struggle, of
course; that would never do. I’m going to send you
to Miss Miriam Braithwaite for to-night. She is an
elderly woman; the cleverest, most entertaining
person imaginable, but, what is far more important,
she comes near to being a saint underneath her disguise
of it! She is my great friend and reliance.
Once more I summon Brother Feely, and he will
telephone Miss Braithwaite, and she will drive over
for you. You’ll enjoy your visit.”</p>

<p>Father Morley made no opening for demur on
Cicely’s part, but she tried to make one.</p>

<p>“Father, I don’t know her! Oh, no! I can’t go!
I’m going home,” she cried.</p>

<p>“You’ll meet Miss Braithwaite within fifteen
minutes, and know her within twenty minutes,” declared
Father Morley, with a slight wave of the
hand that dissipated Cicely’s attempt to resist him.</p>

<p>He called Brother Feely, and bade him telephone
Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>“Tell her I want to send Miss Cicely Adair to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
for the night. She is worn out, tell her; a thoroughly
good girl, whom she will like. Ask her to
come over after her as soon as she can, please; Miss
Adair is needing rest.”</p>

<p>Cis sank back, unable to object; indeed she found
this arrangement something of a relief. She
dreaded a night alone in her room, and dreaded
what she knew would lie before her, an interview
with Rodney which would be beyond her strength.
It was only much later that she realized that Father
Morley had foreseen the same thing, and prevented
it. He had the priest’s intuition which enabled
him to know a great deal that he had not been told.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

INDECISION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CICELY waited the coming of her yet unknown
hostess without much interest in the arrangement
which Father Morley had not only made for
her, but, so to speak, had carried by assault. She
was so utterly tired in body and mind, so prostrated
by the intensity with which she had been feeling
for the past hours that the ability to feel was, for
the time, burned out of her.</p>

<p>She sat back against the garden bench, resting
sidewise so that her arm lay across its back; her
head drooped forward on her shoulder, waiting
quiescent for Miss Braithwaite to come to fetch her
away.</p>

<p>Father Morley waited with her, but he did not
speak to her. He paced the grass slowly, his open
breviary in his hand, his lips moving as he read
each syllable of the sonorous Latin, not slighting it,
but dwelling on its beauties, now that he had time
to read it leisurely.</p>

<p>Cicely lightly dozed as she waited, falling into
the half-submerged, half-conscious sleep of a sick
person; she was spent with excess of emotion.</p>

<p>She did not have long to wait, however. Miss
Braithwaite evidently was accustomed to sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
summons from Father Morley, and to responding
to them without demur, nor question as to what he
asked of her. She told Cis later that “when it came
to a call from Father Morley she was always prepared
for the worst.”</p>

<p>Now she stopped her coupé at the gate beyond
the schoolyard’s high wall which shut the road
from view. Cis did not arouse to hear her, but
Father Morley heard the soft purr of her engine;
its cessation and the slight jar of her brake; shifted
a ribbon in his breviary to mark the place at which
he stopped reading, closed his book and went
toward the gate to welcome his adjutant.</p>

<p>“Lost, strayed or stolen?” Miss Braithwaite thus
asked of the Jesuit a statement of the present case
upon which he had called her.</p>

<p>“Neither—yet. Liable to stray, and finally to be
lost. Badly strained by a contest in which she is
neither victor nor vanquished, so far. You’re to
take her home and arm her anew, as well as to treat
her wounds; hospital case. Interesting and valuable
material,” murmured the priest, turning back
toward Cicely.</p>

<p>She aroused at the sound of their voices. Miss
Braithwaite had nodded comprehendingly to
Father Morley’s summing up, and had said aloud:</p>

<p>“I nearly ran over a child coming here! Little
sinner ran directly before my wheels after he had
almost reached the curbstone, and I had made sure
that I might safely go ahead! I do wish, even if
people don’t highly value their children, that they
would keep them out of the road. It’s most unpleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
to run one down! This bold buccaneer
was about three years old, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Cicely sat up and dropped her hands into her
lap, staring at Miss Braithwaite. She saw a small
person who, at first glimpse, gave the impression of
being topped by a head out of proportion to her
height, but this was due to the remarkable cast of
her countenance, not to the fact. She had a broad,
noble brow; keen, dark eyes, deep-set and not
large, but so alive, so flashing and penetrating that
they held anyone’s attention who saw them for the
first time. Her nose was well-cut, somewhat large,
thin, with a high arch, and her lips were strongly
defined, the upper one meeting the lower one in a
central point. It was the mouth of a person not unsweet,
but not given to what might be called professional
sweetness; her chin was square-cut, and
it lifted in a decided way as she talked. Her voice
penetrated Cicely’s consciousness before she fully
saw her, a voice of the highest cultivation, used
without the least taint of affectation; neither low
nor high, with pleasant, throaty notes, yet with a
resonance that made it insistent, even at a distance.
She spoke every syllable clearly; beautiful English
pronunciation, with inflections suggestive of Italian,
speech so delightful that, though Cis was in no
condition to get pleasure from it, it did enter her
tired brain soothingly, and it drew her to the
woman who was coming toward her with a friendly
smile and a penetrating look.</p>

<p>“Miss Braithwaite, this is Miss Cicely Adair.
Cicely, my child, this is Miss Miriam Braithwaite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
The most that I shall tell you of her is that she is
the best prescription in my pharmacopœia; you’ll
have plenty of occupation in finding out just how
the prescription acts. Cicely Adair is not happy,
Miss Braithwaite; not fit to go to her boarding place
alone to-night; she needs mothering. I’ve told her
that you would take her home with you and put her
to sleep in one of your spacious rooms,” said
Father Morley.</p>

<p>Cicely arose, not quite steadily, and put her cold
hand into Miss Braithwaite’s hand, which took it
into a warm clasp.</p>

<p>“My dear, Father Morley has great confidence in
the most single of single ladies to impute to her
mothering qualities, now hasn’t he? But I’ll be delighted
to have you with me to-night; my maid is
away, and I’m scandalously dependent upon her;
not for service; for companionship! So if you’ll
let me have your youth near me to-night it will be
most opportune and welcome,” said the little lady,
whose whole effect made absurd the idea of her
being dependent upon anything created.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Braithwaite,” said Cis. “I’m
not sure I ought to go; I ought not to bother a perfect
stranger, but Father—”</p>

<p>“Perfect stranger! When we have the same
Father? God, to be sure, but also Father Morley!”
cried Miss Braithwaite. “Why, we’re sisters; you’re
my little sister! Let me whisper to you, my dear;
Father Morley must not hear, though he’s not at all
deaf. Father Morley looks mild; perhaps not too
strong, but he’s an out-and-out tyrant! I do everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
he tells me to, nervously, on the bidding, lest
he fall upon me and flay me! Of course you let
him arrange everything for you; so did I when he
had me called to fetch you! But it’s an all-around
good arrangement, we have to acknowledge that.
He’s a beneficent tyrant; likely would behead you
if you disobeyed him, but puts into your head
things to do that make you better enjoy having a
head.”</p>

<p>Cicely smiled faintly, and turned to the priest
with the suggestion of dawning ease and affection
which this sort of talk was admirably adapted to
awaken. She also felt singularly at home with this
brilliant little woman, with the eyes that saw
through one, the nose of a general, the lips and
voice and hand of a generous soul.</p>

<p>“Father Morley is very good to me; so are you,”
she said simply.</p>

<p>“Then shall we go home immediately and begin
to rest you, my dear?” asked Miss Braithwaite, taking
Cicely’s hand with a strong, yet gently persuasive
grasp and turning toward the gate again.</p>

<p>Father Morley walked beside Cis, bending his
head toward her, not speaking, but as if he were
communing with her without words.</p>

<p>“Good night, my child,” he said when they had
reached the gate. “I will not see you before eleven
to-morrow; you will need to sleep late. After your
first sleep you may waken for awhile, and then you
will sleep into the morning. Miss Braithwaite will
be within call; if you find yourself waking, summon
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>The wise priest well knew the greater likelihood
of complete confidence in the night, rather than the
day.</p>

<p>“I will see you at eleven. If Cicely Adair is able
to come here, bring her to me, please, Miss Braithwaite.
If not, call me up and I will go to see her
at your house.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to see me, Father Morley? But
there is the office; I must be at the office by half
past nine anyway,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Call Mr. Lucas, and tell him, what is strictly
true, that you are not able to report for duty to-morrow.
I would tell him for you, but that an explanation
from me would bias him against your absence
so powerfully that he’d rather send an officer
to hale you to his office than permit your staying
away.” Father Morley laughed, a quietly amused,
inward laugh of enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Lucas? Wilmer Lucas? Oh, I’ll attend to that!”
cried Miss Braithwaite. “He and I clasp hands, in
spite of the Roman shackles on mine. He knows
that my grandfather was intensely Protestant, and
he allows me a slight latitude for the sake of his
honored memory. We often meet in Beaconhite
affairs, and he regards me as a good citizen, which
also helps to fumigate me! He owes me several small
debts for favors received. I’ll call him up and tell
him that I have his bright-haired secretary—are
you his secretary? I didn’t know—in my keeping
and will return her when she is better. Then Miss
Adair will come to you at eleven, Father, unless I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
call you up. Good night, Father Morley. Thank
you for giving me a companion for to-night.”</p>

<p>Father Morley opened the gate for them, and
took Cicely’s hand in his, holding the gate open
with his left hand.</p>

<p>“Good night, my child,” he said gently. “May
God have you in His keeping, and do you hold Him
tight, keeping to Him. Only say in your heart:
‘God help me!’ and it is done! No fear of failure,
wrapped around in His light and His might!”</p>

<p>Cis bowed her head instinctively to receive the
blessing which this wonderful man gave to her, his
face tender and pitiful, grave yet triumphant, as he
feared for her, yet confidently hoped that she
would let God have His way with her at last.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite put Cicely into her car and followed
her, placing herself behind the wheel, liberating
the brake and setting the engine running.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Father,” she said. “Send St. Michael
around to my house to watch over us through the
night after you’ve said your night prayers, please.
Thank you for letting me have this Cicely Adair.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite drove steadily, swinging into a
fifteen miles an hour speed, and varying it but
slightly as she turned from street to street, and
struck out to a side of the city which Cis did not
know well. There were dignified houses along the
way, their grounds increasing in extent, their trees
getting more abundant and taller as the coupé carried
them farther from the street of the Jesuit
church. Miss Braithwaite did not attempt to talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
as she drove, and Cis lay back restfully against the
grey corduroy upholstery, finding it grateful to be
in motion, borne, she did not know whither, without
effort or responsibility on her part. Miss
Braithwaite turned into the broad gateway of one
of the finest houses which Cis had seen, and drew
up before the entrance to the house, having traversed
a long, shaded driveway.</p>

<p>“Here we are, Miss Adair, at home quite safe and
sound. I’m vain of driving, because they say it’s
hard to teach an old dog new tricks and I learned
only last year. I don’t do the idiot things men attribute
to women drivers. Jump out, my dear, and
tell yourself you’re coming home. You haven’t
forgotten how to play house, have you? My man
will come to take the car around to the garage.
Come into the library; there’ll be a log fire on the
hearth there. Here we are! Ah, I love to come
home!” Miss Braithwaite, talking cheerfully, led
the way across and half-way down a great entrance
hall. She threw open one of a pair of doors, letting
Cis precede her into a high-ceiled, wainscoted
room, with high book shelves built around it,
bronzes and beautiful marbles on their tops,
shadowy pictures above them, a glorious fire of
three-foot logs glowing lazily on the hearth, its light
playing over the bindings of the three thousand or
more books which ranged every side of the room,
except the space occupied by the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Cis. “How beautiful!”</p>

<p>“That’s right! You must love this room or
there’s no saying how violently we may quarrel before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the night is over,” said Miss Braithwaite, pulling
up a deeply upholstered semicircular chair before
the fire, and gently pushing Cicely into it. “I’m
so fond of this room that I’m debating how to get a
bill before the legislature to give me more hours in
the day to sit in it. I’m a busy woman, my dear,
and sometimes I think I’m that old person in
Mother Goose who ‘scarce ever was quiet.’ I hope
one of these days to make myself a visit, spend a
week quietly browsing beside this fire! My grandfather
built the house, and began the library; my
father added to them both. I’ve added only to the
library, but isn’t it nice? Throw your hat and coat
over on that straight inglenook chair, and lie back
and watch the flames. Would you like to poke up
the fire? It’s a harmless passion, but it takes strong
hold of one! Take this poker and let air get between
the logs; it’s great fun! We will have supper
in here, beside the fire, and play we’re in a mountain
camp. Do you make believe? It keeps one
going, I assure you. I wouldn’t dare let sensible
people know what silly things I do! I’m supposed
to be a dignified, executive, getting-elderly lady!
But you look much too nice to be sensible! I think
I like you, my dear. Hair like yours is enough to
warm up the first liking! It is glorious, child!
Then your name—Cicely Adair! Might be one of
the seven sweet symphonic names in ‘The Blessed
Damosel’!”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite had chatted on, precluding the
awkwardness of Cicely’s entrance into a strange
house, the guest of an entire stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Miss Braithwaite was supremely indifferent to
the effect of her charm, but she could not help
knowing that she had the gift of winning to her
anyone toward whom she elected to put forth her
powers to please. She had travelled far and lived
long in Europe; had read all her life; was a
gracious, vivacious hostess; had moved in the best
society, the truly fine society of her own land and
England, and, though not beautiful as a young
woman, had been one whom all men honored, admired,
and whom many had sought to wed. Her
mind was brilliant and—a rarer quality in a
woman’s—was logical, with a true sense of justice
and proportion. She was one whom only infinity
could satisfy, and, becoming a convert to the Catholic
Church before her thirtieth year, she had given
over her great gifts to its service, was a factor in its
work, showing it to many another, making her
house, her wealth, her gifted self its consecrated
tools. The priests used her for work which the
women garbed in religious habits could do less well,
which they themselves could not always compass.
Her house had become a sort of perpetual salon;
to it repaired people from distant cities; in it were
organized many movements for good, and in
Miriam Braithwaite the Church had a daughter
whose mere existence sufficiently refuted slander
against the Church, since she could neither be deluded,
nor tolerate anything less than the noblest.</p>

<p>Now Cis, worn and terror-stricken, unable to feel
with the keenness of some hours earlier, yet below
her congealed surfaces reaching out after Rodney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
turning to him, pitying him, hungering for him,
discerned in Miss Braithwaite the qualities which
were hers so supremely, and began to lean out to
her with a blind desire to get from her what was
hers to give.</p>

<p>“Please call me ‘Cis’—that’s what I’m called—‘Cicely,’
if you like it better,” Cis said. “I think
I ought to tell you all about myself.”</p>

<p>“Surely!” Miss Braithwaite agreed cordially.
“Do you know anything so fine as to have someone
trust you enough to confide in you? But supper
first, my dear! I’ll ring for it, and we’ll eat here,
as warm and cozy as two ladybugs. I hope you’re
not too young to care about tea?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-two,” said Cis, with a tiny smile.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s true, what you imply!” cried Miss
Braithwaite, rising to touch a bell. “It’s not the
years, but the palate. Tea is the most refreshingly
restorative thing I know. Ah, Ellen,” she added as
a maid entered. “Will you serve us supper here?
Miss Adair is staying with me. Let us have the cold
chicken, lettuce, small biscuits; the cream cheese,
tea—without cream? Now that’s a sensible girl,
Cicely!—fruit punch, with considerable grape
fruit in it, and a dash of the claret; cake, the white
cake, not the solid one. Perhaps that’s all; perhaps
not. It will do to begin with. Place the table
there, Ellen, please; push away the couch. And
will you please bring the roses from the dining
room?”</p>

<p>Cis was amazed to find herself enjoying this supper,
served beautifully by the quiet-footed, deft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Ellen, before the deep red glow of the smouldering
logs. She ate heartily, and lay back in her low,
cozy chair afterward, feeling better able to cope
with life. But with the return of strength, came
the revival of her longing for Rodney, the conviction
that, cost what it would, she must return to
him. “Now I must tell you, please,” Cis said to
Miss Braithwaite, and she replied: “Now you may.
It is better to tell me before you try to sleep.”</p>

<p>She sat without looking at Cis, shading her face
with her hand, which was one of strong individuality,
rather than actual beauty; not speaking, but
giving the impression of absorbed attention to the
history which Cicely was giving her. She briefly
passed over her early phases, amply telling Miss
Braithwaite her pitiful love story. “And now I
must decide,” she ended. “Rodney or the Church.
It’s not fair, aside from anything else, to leave him
when he was so truthful to me. But I want him!
I must go to him! I left him in our home, alone!
When I was in the church I thought, perhaps, I’d
stick to the Catholic Church, but no, no, no! Telling
you about him has made me see. It must be
Rodney; I’m his wife. See, that’s his ring, made
for me, Miss Braithwaite.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Miss Braithwaite quietly. “A
ruby. The Church wears red on the festivals of
her martyrs. How good God is to you, how He loves
you! In choosing Him you will save the poor fellow
whom you love, but whom God loves more, my
Cicely! Your sacrifice will bring Rodney back at
last. Don’t you know that is the way these miracles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
are wrought? How fine that it was such as you
whom Rodney loved when he was an outcast from
God! It might so easily have been a weak girl who
did not love Rodney truly, tremendously, as you
can, as you do, and so who would have renounced
her Faith; sealed Rodney’s doom; gone with him
into sin, degradation, the awful hatred of each
other which waits upon those who debase love.
With a living wife Rodney cannot marry. Cis, dear,
you are not really hesitating! You are not going
into that horrible abyss. It is only your torn heart
crying out, but your will is God’s. Little Cicely, be
glad that you can suffer for Our Lord. It is He
Who stands between you and the breaking of His
unmistakable law. He is going to bring Rodney
back because you will ask it, who have offered Him
the sacrifice of a broken heart. Don’t let yourself
imagine that you are hesitating in your loyalty to
Our Lord! Fancy, turning Our Lord out of your
life for the sake of anyone, or everyone whom He
has made! Wouldn’t it be a lonely world, dear, if
we drove out of it that great white Figure which
towers above us, just before us at every step? Cicely
Adair to say: ‘Go away from me, Lord Jesus, with
Your wounds and beauty! With Your love, beyond
anything that I can mean by love!’ Unthinkable,
child! Come now, dear one; come to bed. Sleep
and rest, for never, never will you be a traitor, betray
your Lord. We won’t talk longer to-night.
You’re nearly exhausted again. I’ll put you to bed,
child, and thank you for letting me shelter someone
who wears a ring of the martyr color, and is going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
to suffer to the end for loyalty to Our Lord Who
died for her—and me!”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite had gone on at length, for
Cicely was sitting erect, wide-eyed, her face changing
as she listened, and Miss Braithwaite knew that
she was winning her to great heroism. It was not
the first time that Miriam Braithwaite had fought
and won a like battle for the right.</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t, don’t! I can’t!” Cicely cried, but she
arose and threw herself on her knees before Miss
Braithwaite, clasping her tight, shaking with sobs
which brought no tears; broken, weak, yet with a
dawning strength.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite helped Cicely to her bed,
brushed and plaited her abundant hair; it fell
around the girl in red masses of glory. Then she
put Cicely between fragrant sheets, switched off
the strong lights, switched on a low reading lamp,
its hooded screen turned toward herself, dark
toward the bed, and began to read the story of the
Passion from St. Matthew’s Gospel. “She cannot
deny her Lord in the morning if she sleeps with
this in her ears,” Miss Braithwaite thought, reading
in her beautifully modulated voice the infinite
pathos of those selfless hours.</p>

<p>Cicely slept deeply, wakening but once, and then
not to lie awake as Father Morley had foreseen her
doing, but falling off again into the profound sleep
of complete exhaustion.</p>

<p>She arose in the morning steadier in nerves; the
first poignancy of her agony laid for the moment,
but sure to leap up again to tear at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>After a delicious breakfast in Miss Braithwaite’s
pretty morning room, her hostess arose.</p>

<p>“It will soon be eleven, Cicely dear. You are
quite fit to go to Father Morley? I need not ask
him to come here?” she said.</p>

<p>“I could go there, but why does he want me?”
asked Cicely.</p>

<p>“I never ask why Father Morley wants me; I’m
too grateful to be allowed to see him,” said Miss
Braithwaite smiling. “He is the most saintly person
I have ever known, and his father, a convert,
once an Episcopalian clergyman, was a confessor of
the Faith, who suffered for it. This saintly son was
his reward, one of his rewards! I’ll write three tiny
notes, Cicely, then we’ll go in my coupé to ask
Father Morley himself, what he wants of brave
Cis!”</p>

<p>At half past ten Miss Braithwaite and Cis set
forth, “not to risk keeping Father Morley waiting,”
Miss Braithwaite said.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you here, and return for you,” she
told Cis, stopping her car before the Jesuit house
and school. “I have two people whom I ought to
see this morning, if it is at all possible. I’ll be back
here not later than noon, I hope. But wait for me;
I won’t fail you. One never is able to make a positive
engagement to the minute, when a car is involved
in its keeping.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

DECISION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE lay-brother who responded to Cicely’s summons
on the bell was old, slow moving, kindly,
but remote from daily affairs. He was probably inured
to the coming of harassed people in hot
haste to see one of the priests, and had learned to
feel that haste was unnecessary, trouble but fleeting.</p>

<p>“Father Morley is expecting someone; he told me
to say that he could not see anyone but her till after
dinner. Would you be her? Cicely Adair was the
name,” the old brother said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Father Morley told me to come at eleven,”
replied Cicely.</p>

<p>“It’s prompt you are,” commented the brother,
raising his hand for Cis to listen to the slow striking
of a clock. “Go into that parlor yonder, the third
one down; the first two are occupied.”</p>

<p>Cis obeyed, and found herself in a narrow room,
longer than was in good proportion to its width,
furnished in a strictly utilitarian manner. A table
stood in the centre, its top inset with green leather,
a drawer running its length. Three cane-seated
straight chairs, and one cane-seated armchair constituted
the furniture of the room; on one side of
the wall was a copy of a Murillo Madonna with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
pretty, blank face and too little chin; opposite to it
an engraving of the then-reigning Pope.</p>

<p>Father Morley did not keep Cis waiting five minutes;
he had been awaiting her. He entered with
a smile, gave her one sharp look, and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my dear. You look better; I
hope you are somewhat rested?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Father. I slept hard. Miss Braithwaite
was very kind,” Cis said.</p>

<p>“When was Miriam Braithwaite otherwise, I
wonder!” Father Morley said. “Tell me exactly
what you think of her house and of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the house!” Cis regained something of her
animation as she repeated the words. “It is the
most beautiful, and at the same time the dearest
house in the world! That library! Full of books!”</p>

<p>“It surely is. Have you found out that ‘the
library’ in many houses has no books in it?” Father
Morley smiled at Cis as if he were sharing a pleasant
bit of humor with her. “The Braithwaites have
been book-lovers for generations. Well, and your
hostess?”</p>

<p>“She is wonderful,” cried Cis heartily. “She is
the finest lady I ever saw, but she doesn’t bother
about it one bit. She makes you feel as though
she’d do anything, and not be afraid; she’s daring,
as if she was riding a spirited horse, yet she is pious—well,
I don’t know exactly how she is pious! As
if she rode that horse of hers right up to heaven
and nothing could stop her!”</p>

<p>Father Morley flashed upon Cis a look which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
could not understand; it was surprised and delighted.</p>

<p>“My dear child, that is an inspired characterization!”
he cried. “You have precisely hit off Miriam
Braithwaite. If you can see that, we shall have you
riding after her, her squire, upon her knightly errantry
to eternity. Admirable, my child! I think
you, too, are one who would greatly dare. You are
to be a force for God in a world that needs that.
And now, are you ready to tell me all about it, and
let me give you a hand into the saddle for your
own brave riding heavenward?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father. I’d rather not tell you, but if I
hadn’t made up my mind to it I wouldn’t have come
to see you,” said Cis. “Do you remember that I
met you one Sunday coming away from the fire in
those tenements in Harvest Street? And that I was
with a young man?”</p>

<p>“Who was good looking and ready-tongued,
whose name was Moore, but who told me that he
had left the Church? Naturally I remember finding
one of my girls under those influences,” the
Jesuit said.</p>

<p>“I am engaged to him,” said Cis. “We were to
be married on Christmas eve; my birthday is
Christmas, and we have a lovely little apartment
partly furnished. But—” Cis stopped.</p>

<p>“Yes? But, my child? You <i>were</i> to have been
married? Past tense? You have learned that you
cannot marry?” suggested Father Morley.</p>

<p>“Rodney has been true and honorable; he could
not bring himself to marry me without telling me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Cis cried with a piteous look of appeal to the priest
to acknowledge this fineness. “He had been married
before; he is divorced. But his wife is dreadful;
he couldn’t stay married to her. He has an absolute
divorce; he can marry again.”</p>

<p>“Of course you know that he cannot,” the Jesuit
quietly corrected her. “He has the legal right to
marry, I’ve no doubt, and we all have the tragic
power to cast off our allegiance to God, but he cannot
marry as you and I understand marriage. The
Church does not demand the continuance of married
life when it is outrageously degraded by one of
the spouses, but you know that it is not within her
power to annul the relation which lasts till death.
Rodney Moore must endure his lot under the law
which no pope nor council promulgated; God Incarnate
declared it solemnly. Laws are for the general
good, my child; they often bear hard on the individual,
but that does not abrogate them. Moore
was married to a nominal Catholic? Both baptized?
Married by a priest?”</p>

<p>Then, as Cis bowed her head to each interrogation,
Father Morley shook his head. “I am profoundly
sorry for you, my daughter, but let us rejoice
that the young man had left alive in him the
decency not to deceive you. You are saved from a
position which you would have assumed innocently,
not knowing that the man was married, yet
which would have been unfathomable wretchedness
when you discovered the truth, that you were
unmarried; only sheltered by the feeble arm of the
state, which has no jurisdiction over the sacraments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
My child, I hardly know whether to be
more sorry for your present suffering, or more glad
that you are saved from far, immeasurably far,
worse torture.”</p>

<p>“Father Morley, you don’t understand,” Cis protested.
“You talk as if it were all off; it isn’t! I
left Rodney after he told me, and I promised him
to think it out, and tell him what I decided. I was
shocked, horrified; I don’t mind owning that, but
he is perfectly splendid. I love him, oh, I love
him! He says we build up all these ideas; that it is
ridiculous to torment ourselves with these laws of
the Church. He says God is not so unjust; he says
that we should be truly—and, oh, how happily!—married.
He wants me to come out bravely and
marry him in the mayor’s office, or somewhere, and
be with him forever.”</p>

<p>“You mean for years, when you say forever,”
Father Morley reminded her, allowing no note of
disturbance to creep into his voice. “‘Forever’
is precisely the wrong word there. In point of
fact it would be strictly a temporal union; I
doubt its outlasting to old age, but it would most
certainly not be forever, eternal! You know, Miss
Adair, that people easily drift into the habit of
divorce. This man would not be bound to you by
stronger bonds than his inclination. The marriage
made in the mayor’s office can easily be set aside in
one of the lower courts. The Church, you see,
alone safeguards the woman. Wicked though this
young man’s wife may be, probably is, still her
marriage is safeguarded for her to repent within its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
walls. Her husband can repudiate her degradation,
but he cannot replace her. You, if you went
to live with him, pronounced his wife by a city
official, would not be safeguarded at all, although
you might not be the scorned woman that his wife
is. Look you, Cicely Adair, you would not be better
than she! With full knowledge you would reject
your God and profane your own soul by the
breaking of His law.”</p>

<p>“Father Morley, do you mean that I—that I
would be—would be—like her?” gasped Cis.</p>

<p>“Perhaps far worse,” said the priest. “You do
not know her temptations, her enlightenment, her
instruction; she may have been weak and wretched,
rather than deliberately wicked; you don’t know.
But you, clear-eyed, instructed, independent, able
to look after yourself, you are dallying deliberately
with good and evil, weighing both. If you denied
your God what excuse would you give Him when
you saw Him at last? That man tells you to come
out from the Church <i>bravely</i>! Bravely! Faugh!
That is not courage; it is cowardice, the coward who
will not face pain for the sake of the Lord Who
bore so much for her! A coward, I tell you! And
do you realize that this country of ours is honeycombed
with the divorce evil? That homes are
wrecked, children made destitute, men and women
sunk into vileness because they will not be denied
their successive fancies, and that they profane marriage
because they will not bear the brand of their
true label? Will you tolerate the idea of joining
their ranks, of helping to spread the poison which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
eats away the very foundation of civilization? And
then call that <i>brave</i>? Benedict Arnold tried to betray
Washington and the gate to the north. What
would your treason betray? You are disloyal, even
to your land, when you do not set your face against
that which is undermining her. Don’t let yourself
call your temptation by pretty names. It is not
courage, but cowardice. It is not being married by
a magistrate, for they cannot marry; it is being
licensed to be called Mrs. Rodney Moore, but remaining
the shamed Cicely Adair.”</p>

<p>“Father Morley,” poor Cicely’s voice shook with
dry sobs, “don’t you see? Rod is great; he is not
bad. Didn’t God Himself give him to me to love?”</p>

<p>“Possibly; I don’t say no,” said the priest gently.
“There are many strange ways by which souls are
led home. But decidedly God did not give Rodney
to you to marry, for he is not free to marry, and
God does not want you to help Rodney to go lower.
Perhaps he is given you to love and to save by sacrificing
for him your happiness; it looks to me probable.
Evidently Rodney has good in him, or he
would not have told you that he was married, until
he had you in his power. I can see how you love
him when you can entertain an idea so repugnant
to you as denying your Faith for him. This is your
way of salvation, and in taking the right turn you
can offer to God your pain; it will plead for grace
for Rodney, cut off from it by his own act.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that, Father,” whispered Cis. “But,
oh—never to see him? Never, never? This is my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
engagement ring; Rodney made the design; I am a
Christmas child.”</p>

<p>The priest bent forward better to see it; his
vision was short.</p>

<p>“A beautiful ring, my child; a beautiful design,
beautifully wrought, but I see in it far more than
the Christmas thought of your nativity which Rodney
Moore meant to embody. It is the ring of
prophecy. Red, the color of the martyrs; the
heart’s blood upheld by thorns, but therein glowing
and burning celestially. Yes, my child, it is indeed
your betrothal ring!”</p>

<p>Cis lifted her hand closer to her own eyes,
dimmed with tears, and studied the ring as if it
were new to her. Her hand shook so that the beautiful
ruby emitted gleams of light, emphasizing
the priest’s interpretation of it. Its wearer’s grief
made it more beautiful.</p>

<p>For some time there was silence in the bare little
parlor. Father Morley spoke no word; he left Cicely
to absorb the words which he had spoken to her,
spoken in his low, thrilling voice, straight to her
soul. He ran through his fingers the beads of the
rosary which hung from the black braid girdle that
strapped his cassock, not speaking, praying for the
soul before him fighting, tossing on black waters
into which he could not enter. As each soul must
struggle alone in mortal danger, seizing or rejecting
aid, so this priest could only stand on the shore
ready with powerful help, but he could not force
the issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>At last Father Morley arose and crossed the narrow
room. He took from the wall a crucifix which
Cicely had not noticed in taking account of its furnishings;
it hung back of where she was sitting. It
was a rare, a wonderful crucifix; the livid Figure
upon it was marvellously carved with an expression
of utter agony, dominated by a supreme love. This
crucifix the Jesuit took from its nail, and, coming
back, he bent over Cicely, holding out to her the
cross.</p>

<p>She dropped her shaking hands into her lap, and
lifted her eyes, first to the crucifix, then, piteously,
to the kind, insistent face above it which looked
down on her with pity yet with the assurance of
awaiting good in the deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>“See, Cicely Adair, what was done for you. Can
you count what you bear for Him? Can you refuse
Him, especially that He promises surely that He
will fill your soul with such joy as you have never
known, if you hold to Him? Look, child, at the
wounds; are you going to clinch your hands, like a
niggard of the gift He asks? See the Side, riven
that you may know what His Heart is! Will you go
out from Him into shame, be an outcast from His
altar, excommunicated? Cicely Adair, these lips
are still athirst for the draft you hesitate to give
them. Are you going to hold up to them vinegar
and gall—again? You must give up Rodney; you
must not betray your Lord; you must put that
blood-red ruby at the foot of the cross. You must
not delay. What is your answer, my child?”</p>

<p>Cicely remained silent, trembling so that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
whole body shook, but tearless, and all the time
Father Morley waited, holding before her eyes the
eloquent crucifix to plead with her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cicely cried out with a long, low, heart-wrung
cry, and sprang up, falling on her knees, her
face bowed in her hands.</p>

<p>“I can’t—I can’t—leave Him!” she said.</p>

<p>Father Morley misunderstood.</p>

<p>“Child, you must!” he said. “You must leave
him.”</p>

<p>Cicely looked up, and a queer, dazed smile
passed over her miserable face. “Oh, you don’t
mean that! You mean Rodney! I mean God. I
can’t, I can’t leave God,” she cried, and caught her
breath in a strange little laugh, wholly like the Cis
who could not help recognizing humor, however
unmerry her tragic mood.</p>

<p>Father Morley smiled. His relief was unspeakable;
he had won. He knew that if this girl chose
she would abide by her choice; he knew that Cicely
Adair was safe. And he felt a new, moving pity for
her that she could smile at his urging her to forsake
God, misunderstanding her pronoun, though the
lips which twisted into the attempt to smile had just
spoken the doom of her longing love for her lover.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my daughter, my brave, true
girl!” the priest said. “Come, rise up. How really
you have arisen! Shall we go into the church? I
think we both should thank God, thank the Holy
Spirit that has guarded you and inspired you. Will
you not go to confession, Cicely? To-morrow
morning you must receive the Lord to Whom you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
have remained faithful. And then come to Him as
nearly every day as you can, for He will carry you
over the dark patch of roadway before you, into
that bright light just beyond. Come, my dear, into
the church. Shall I ask one of our Fathers to hear
your confession? There are two or three in the
house, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Cis let Father Morley help her to her feet, as she
said:</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear confessions, Father? I don’t
have to go twice, do I?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear; only once to-day!” Father Morley
smiled at Cis, who, this time, did not know why he
looked amused. “I thought you might prefer someone
else to me. Come, then.”</p>

<p>“Miss Braithwaite said she would come after me
here,” said Cis. “Perhaps I ought to wait for her.”</p>

<p>“To be sure; she would come after you!” Father
Morley cried admiringly. “She never half does
anything! I’ll tell the brother where you are; she’ll
look for you in the church, though I’m quite sure
she would look for you there anyway, even though
no word were left for her.”</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour later Miss Braithwaite
turned her car around before the church.
Cicely sat in the corner, her elbow on the top of
the upholstered box which was behind the driver’s
seat, her head supported by her hand. She was
quiet, but Miss Braithwaite hardly needed the reassuring
smile which Father Morley gave her from
the church step where he was seeing them off to tell
her that Cicely was at peace. Her face was worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and profoundly sad, but there was a new quality in
its sadness, the serenity of a right decision.</p>

<p>On the way to her house Miss Braithwaite hardly
spoke. Cis had feebly protested against returning
there, but Miss Braithwaite had decisively told her
that there was no question of her going elsewhere,
at least till after New Year’s. For one thing, her
maid would be away for the rest of that week and
Miss Braithwaite wanted someone to talk to; after
that she expected to have grown so accustomed to
talking to Cicely that she must keep her on.</p>

<p>Cis smiled, seeing the kindness that wanted to
avoid thanks; too weary to discuss it; at heart relieved
that she might stay in this peaceful and
noble house, under the spell of its noble, though
somewhat eccentric mistress.</p>

<p>At lunch Miss Braithwaite told Cis about the
two cases which had occupied her that morning,
and she succeeded in interesting the girl in spite of
her preoccupation with her own thoughts. Miss
Braithwaite’s incisive English, clear-cut, finished,
like a collection of cameos and intaglios in words,
fascinated Cicely’s ear, drawing her mind on to interest
in the matter behind the speech.</p>

<p>“Would you rather go to your room, or will you
keep me company before the fire in the library,
Cicely?” asked Miss Braithwaite as they arose from
the table.</p>

<p>“May I talk to you awhile?” asked Cis.</p>

<p>“All the afternoon; I’ve nothing on, and hoped
you’d linger with me,” replied Miss Braithwaite,
putting her arm around the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Thus she led her into that dusky, glowing room
which had so charmed Cis on the preceding evening,
and again put her into the deep chair of that
first acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Miss Braithwaite, I’ve been to confession,” Cis
said abruptly.</p>

<p>“That accounts for the new quiet, an atmosphere
of peace about you, Cicely dear,” said Miss Braithwaite,
leaning over and putting her hand on the
girl’s bright hair. “You have enlisted! Thank God
for that. Don’t imagine the victory is won, but
your side can’t lose, you know; it’s only a matter of
days and weeks! Then your banner on the tower!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Braithwaite,” said poor Cis somewhat
forlornly. “I am thankful, you know. Only—What
must be done I’d better do as quickly, as fast
as I can. I promised to let him—let Rod hear from
me. He has no idea where I am. He will have
looked for me everywhere that I might have been,
but he’ll never guess I’m here. He is half mad by
now. I must write him and send him this ring. I
must tell him it is good-bye. Miss Braithwaite, I
can’t see him! I couldn’t bear what he would say
to me. I’m afraid to see him, that’s the truth, but
it would kill me to say good-bye, see him go away—I
can’t stand it!” Cis’s voice rose on a hard, sharp
note, and Miss Braithwaite laid her own hand over
Cicely’s.</p>

<p>“I know, I understand. I’ll keep him off you.
Write him here, now, dear Cis, and inclose the ring.
Don’t harass yourself by writing a long letter; the
whole matter can be condensed into a few words.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
You have chosen God; you are true to your first
promises; that is all. But be sure to tell him how
fully you appreciate his truth in dealing with you,
albeit he spoke tardily, for we do not forget that we
want to bring Rodney right, and it will infuriate
him if he thinks that you do not attribute to him
the good that was in him when he gave you the
chance you are taking to free yourself from a wrong
position,” said this good woman, patting Cicely’s
hand as mothers pat their babies to sleep.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Braithwaite; I’d thought that would
be what I must do,” said Cis. “I have nothing with
me, you know. Have you a pen that won’t be
spoiled by another person’s using it? It ruins pens
to lend them; I know that.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of pens, besides the one that I guard like
a seven-headed monster!” declared Miss Braithwaite
rising with an alacrity that forbade Cis’s considering
the coming note in its proper light. “Come
to my desk over here, and take any pen you like,
save that one.”</p>

<p>Cis followed her, and took the straight chair
which stood before the desk.</p>

<p>She wrote slowly, pausing often, passing her hand
over her eyes frequently, as if she could not see,
but there was no moisture on the fingers afterward.</p>

<p>She laid before Miss Braithwaite the completed
note, saying only:</p>

<p>“Please tell me if it is wrong in any way. I hope
he’ll know that it is hard to write him this. December
1st, isn’t it? Christmas eve is very near.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite read; she had never seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Cicely’s writing before, but she knew that this irregular,
wavering hand could not be the usual writing
of this extremely definite girl with the strong,
vivid face, the bright, radiant red hair.</p>

<p>“Dear Rodney:” the note ran. “I cannot marry
you because you cannot marry me. It cannot be a
marriage so I must go away, never come to the dear
apartment again. I will not disobey God. If He
helps me, I will die first, and, Rod, oh, Rod, this is
like dying! You will be angry, and say that I do
not love you, but if you try to remember me as I
was, you will know that I love you. Perhaps if I
loved you less I might not care so much to do right.
I am sending you the ring. It was not a holly berry,
but the heart’s blood of your Christmas Cis that the
ruby meant. Dear Rod, I bless you for your
truthful dealing with me, that you would not trick
me into the marriage which would never be a true
one in the eyes of either of us, for we were both
Catholics. I will try to be a better one so that God
will hear me beg Him to bless you and bring you
back. Will you please not try to see me, dear?
Nothing that you could say would make me believe
that it was right to marry you when you have a living
wife, but the struggle to keep right is too hard
on me, and I could not see you go away forever and
live through it. I’ve borne all I can. So don’t see
me, my dearest, but don’t forget me. Good-bye—it
means God be with you, you know. Cis.”</p>

<p>“It is quite right, dear girl,” said Miss Braithwaite
gently, touching the piteous little letter softly,
as if it were a dead child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Cis drew off her ring and kissed it many times.
Then she dropped it into Miss Braithwaite’s lap.</p>

<p>“Will you wrap it up in the letter and send it for
me?” Cis said. “You are good to me, Miss Braithwaite.
Will you teach me how to be this new Cis?
The world used to be full of sounds; it seems to be
quite still and empty. I suppose when you’re dead
it’s like that. I don’t know which way to walk.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

WITNESSING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS BRAITHWAITE had to waken Cis in the
morning to get her up in time to drive with
her to St. Francis Xavier’s for Mass.</p>

<p>It was a Mass of renunciation and espousal, a
communion that pledged Cicely to turn from her
forbidden love for Rodney to allegiance to God,
yet she felt this but dimly. She went through the
Mass dutifully, but humbly; she realized that she
was vowing herself and that her vow was then accepted.
Her will acquiesced, but at least one of the
other powers of her soul was atrophied. Below her
surfaces pain waited her awakening; she willed her
martyrdom unfalteringly, but there was for her
none of the martyrs’ triumphant joy. Yet she received
the Lord Who had once raised a maiden from
the dead, and, groping for Him, found Him, how
truly she did not then know.</p>

<p>“I must go to the office,” Cis said suddenly to
Miss Braithwaite at breakfast. “I wonder why I’ve
only just thought of it? How could I forget! It is
half past nine already. Miss Braithwaite, what shall
I do? Ought I telephone Mr. Lucas first, ask him
if he still wants me to come? You had me excused
for only one day.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I didn’t,” said Miss Braithwaite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
promptly. “I didn’t specify the length of your absence.
I told Mr. Lucas that Cicely Adair was not
at all well, could not possibly take up her duties,
but that if she weren’t able to resume them in less
than a week he should hear from me again. He was
entirely amiable, bade me let him know, also, if
you needed anything that he could procure for you.
So you are perfectly all right to be absent again
to-day. If you feel like going down to-morrow I’ll
drive you down myself; we shall see!”</p>

<p>“How good you are to me, Miss Braithwaite!”
cried Cis. “And I never shall be able to do the
least thing for you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of it!” cried Miss Braithwaite.
“I have designs on you! A girl of your sort can do
no end of things for me, a proxy me, who is far
more important than the me direct. There are several
things near and dear to my heart which are
more interesting and important than a fusty, aging
maiden lady, Cicely Adair. For instance, I can
imagine you giving my ragged hoodlum lads a royal
good time when you’re ready for it; my little scalawag
boys whose qualities are a plaid; black and
white, good and bad, fairly evenly mixed, though I
do believe that the black has white hair lines in its
blocks!”</p>

<p>“Orphan asylum?” asked Cis listlessly, yet her
eyes had brightened slightly.</p>

<p>“Industrial school, orphans or half-orphans,
little boys whom we Catholics must hold tight; if
we relax in the least the devil will slip a claw in
underneath our loosened fingers!” replied Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Braithwaite turning toward her maid, then bringing
in the mail of the first delivery of that day.</p>

<p>“I was great pals with a funny bunch of newsies
at home,” said Cis, biting her lip and glancing
anxiously at the small clock behind her as the sight
of the letters reminded her of the note which Rodney
might then be reading. Or had not Miss
Braithwaite sent it out the previous night? She had
not asked, she did not ask now, but the letters
which Miss Braithwaite was assorting gave her the
sickened feeling with which one hears the first
clods fall upon a casket which the guy ropes have
just let down forever.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d be great pals with that sort of
youngster, Cicely,” returned Miss Braithwaite,
cheerfully adopting Cis’s terms. “Letter for you,
my dear; I had your mail sent here, from Miss Wallace’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Nan!” cried Cis. “Thank you, Miss
Braithwaite.”</p>

<p>She read her letter with a moved face and laid it
down softly, stroking the pages.</p>

<p>“She’ll be married on Christmas; she has hurried
her arrangements because she wants us married together.
Dear little Nannie! Good little Nan! She
is happy, but she deserves to be. I hope she will
be, always,” Cis murmured, her face wistful, sad,
but a gentle smile in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, happiness is a term of comparison,
but it usually takes years to teach us this,” said
Miss Braithwaite. “If your little bride-friend is
good, with the sort of goodness you convey an impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
of, she is likely to be happy. Enkindled
people rise to rapture, but they sink into wretchedness;
it’s safer to shine by refraction than to be enkindled,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“How do you know the things you understand,
Miss Braithwaite?” cried Cis. “I have hardly talked
of Nan to you, yet you have her measure! I must
write her, tell her. It will make her most unhappy!
I don’t know how I can tell her I’m not to be married,
after all. Nan will feel like a thief to be
happy when I’m not. And she has taken the same
day, so that we could be happy together, though
apart. I won’t tell her anything except that my plan
is all off, done with forever. I bought some lovely,
perfectly beautiful damask, Miss Braithwaite;
three table-cloths, napkins for each, and I’ve been
doing hemstitched hems. They were for me, you
know, for—Luckily they’re not marked yet. I’m
not much good at embroidery, though I drew the
threads and hemstitched quite decently. I was
going to have them marked, embroidered letters,
you know—‘<i>C. A.</i>’ I’d better have them marked
A. M. D.—Anne Margaret Dowling—and send
them to Nan, hadn’t I? Would that be nice? I almost
feel as though anything of mine might bring
her bad luck!”</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as bad luck, Cis child!”
cried Miss Braithwaite, trying not to let Cis see how
much her quiet renunciation of her sweet hopes,
stitched into her linen, moved her. “I am sure that
your damask would bring Nan blessing; it is a cloth
from an altar of sacrifice! It would be a beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
gift, child, and Nan need not know, not now, at
least, that it was at first intended for another
home.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go around to Miss Wallace’s to-day and
get it then,” said Cis with a grateful look for
her hostess. “And, Miss Braithwaite, I’ve got to
plan. I’ve a good position here, I like Beaconhite,
and I’ve got to live somewhere, but—I’ll always be
afraid to walk out; I can’t meet Rod. Don’t you
think, perhaps, I’d better go away? Not home;
somewhere? And, oh, do you think Rod will try
to see me? Miss Braithwaite, I can’t see him!
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been considering these points, Cis, my
dear,” said Miss Braithwaite, evidently equipped
with a decision upon them. “I am sure that Rodney
Moore will try to see you once. I think that he will
come here; he will hardly attempt to say to you
what he will want to say in the street, meeting you
on your way to and from the Lucas and Henderson
offices. You need not see him here; I will see him
for you. After that, I am hopeful that he will let
you alone. I do not know him, but I know human
nature, and I believe that after I have seen him for
you, he will let you alone. As to keeping on with
the office, that is as you please. But, Cicely, I have
a proposition which I want you to consider; to be
truthful, I do not want you to consider it, but to
take it up at once. I am a solitary woman in this
great house, with no one but servants around me.
I want you to spend the winter here, with me. I
hope for your help in my schemes; Father Morley’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
girls’ club, my tatterdemalions, other things. You
are young, attractive, bright; you can do all sorts of
work for these objects. Then, for me, you can do
more! Be a little fond of me, talk to me, companion
me. And, last not least, for yourself; read
my books—perhaps not every one on those shelves,
but many of them; play a little, study a little, think
a great deal; you went through school, now give
yourself a little riper, deeper, higher education!
And, Cis, dear, learn your faith! It seems a pity
to miss its beauty, the joy it has for you, when
you’ve bravely embraced unhappiness for it! As
if you had risked your life for one almost a stranger,
as you thought, and suddenly discovered it was
your dearest, beloved friend! You’ll be delighted
with the Church, my dear, when you get acquainted
with her beauty! Dear, you’ve missed happiness
and it’s hard, but happiness more profound and
lasting is within your reach; I promise it to you!
Now, Cis, will you stay with me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Braithwaite, I’d just dearly love to!”
cried Cicely, springing up to throw herself on her
knees beside Miss Braithwaite, her radiant head on
her shoulder, sobbing a little, yet with the first ray
of comforting hope penetrating her despair.</p>

<p>Cicely arose the next morning to resume life on
its new basis, yet under its old routine. This is,
perhaps, the hardest strain imposed upon anyone
who is newly bereft, by death or by the crueller
deprivations of life. To go once more amid the familiar
surroundings, greet the accustomed faces
with a surface smile, seeing with bewildered amazement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
that the eyes smiling back recognize one for
the same person that they have always seen though
one feels like a shade walking the earth in the
semblance of life, this is to deepen that painful
sense of remoteness from common experience,
which is the lasting hallmark of profound suffering.</p>

<p>It was decided that Cis was to spend the winter
with Miss Braithwaite. She was glad to accept the
shelter of this house, yet more glad of the home
open to her in the affections of this clever and
spiritual gentlewoman than of the actual shelter of
her dignified roof. For Cis, to her own bewilderment,
found herself with little of her natural self-reliance.
Beaten down by her recent struggle,
though she had emerged victorious, she was scarred
and torn by wounds still bleeding; she had accurately
described herself to Miss Braithwaite as not
knowing “how to walk.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite’s hand guiding her was strong
and warm; she sustained her stumbling feet,
poured the wine of her wholesome, humorous point
of view into her wounds, and, at the same time,
taught her to see the Perfect Beauty which by its
perfection made all else worthless.</p>

<p>Beyond her winter with Miss Braithwaite, Cis
laid no plans; she was not sure whether or not she
should continue in Mr. Lucas’ office; for that matter,
she was not sure that she might do so. She had
determined to confess to Mr. Lucas her fault in giving
to Rodney Moore the hint he had asked for as
to the final outcome of the franchise which was
agitating the public mind. She would not stay on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
with him unless Mr. Lucas knew the worst of her;
after he knew it the decision about her staying was
in his hands. She had notified Mr. Lucas that she
would leave him before Christmas to be married;
he probably had supplied her place from that time
on. Well, all this was as it might be. Dressing
slowly, with long intervals of absent-minded gazing
out of the window, Cis was sure only that she was
going to the office, confess to Mr. Lucas, do the one
thing left her honorably to do; after that—nothing
mattered greatly, anyway. She did not know, nor
much care what came after that.</p>

<p>Cis would not acknowledge to herself that she
feared, with positively curdling fear, meeting Rodney.
She felt sure that he would try to waylay her
when she resumed her daily trips to and from the
office. It seemed to her that if she withstood him,
his reproaches, but much more his appeals—and
she was sure that she could withstand them—that
afterward the feeble ray of courage within her
would be extinguished; that she had borne to her
capacity.</p>

<p>Therefore it was an unspeakable relief to find
that Miss Braithwaite was taking her down that
morning in her coupé and planning to bring her
home at night.</p>

<p>“You’re not quite at par, my dear, though you
intend to take dictation in regard to soaring investments,”
she said. “I’m going in all sorts of directions
this morning; the Lucas and Henderson offices
one of them, so you’re to be deposited at their door
with no exertion on your part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Oh, Miss Braithwaite, I’ll never be able to
thank you!” cried Cis. “How you do see through
people! But I don’t mind your knowing I’m a
coward.”</p>

<p>“A certain sort of cowardice is the highest courage,
child; the courage to acknowledge danger and
flee from it. Come along, Cicely Adair! Did you
ever see that ridiculous Dollinger ballad? All about
the dangerous voyage of a canal boat of which one
Dollinger was captain? The refrain of each stanza
is: ‘Fear not, but trust in Dollinger and he will
fetch you through.’ It doesn’t matter; only old
fogies know it, I suppose. Regard me as Dollinger,
for I mean to fetch you through! Come, then!”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite slipped her hand into Cis’s arm
and took her out to the waiting car. Then she
started off and drove Cicely to her destination,
where she left her with a heartening pat on her
shoulder and the promise to return for her at five.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas looked up with a smile of greeting
when he heard Cis’s light touch on the handle of
the office door, but the smile died on his lips, replaced
by a look of concern, as he started to his feet
at the sight of her.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Adair, I had no idea that you had
been seriously ill; I did not get that impression
from Miriam Braithwaite. Pray take my chair till
you are rested. I am profoundly sorry to see you
so white and weakened,” he cried, kindly coming
forward to take Cicely’s hand and gently force her
into his own armchair.</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Lucas, thank you,” said Cis, resisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
his kindness. “I have not been ill. Something happened—I
had a shock—I’ll be all right soon. Mr.
Lucas, before I begin to work, before you say another
word to me, there is something that I must
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured Mr. Lucas, experienced in
human nature, and instantly guessing something of
what he was to be told. “I am ready to listen, Miss
Adair.”</p>

<p>“I was engaged to be married; I told you that I
was to have been married at Christmas; I resigned
for that date for that reason,” said Cis, plunging,
without letting herself delay her confession. “Rod—Mr.
Moore, the one I was to marry—begged me
to give him a hint about the franchise. He had
some money; he wanted to buy that stock if the
franchise was going through. He swore he would
not let a hint of it get beyond him; I’m sure he
wouldn’t—”</p>

<p>“Why is everyone sure that everyone else will be
more honorable in keeping a secret than he—or
she—is?” asked Mr. Lucas dryly. “I see that you
parted with mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Lucas, but indeed, indeed I held out
long against it; I didn’t want to do it; I’ve always
been quite straight,” cried Cis. “But Rod begged
so hard; he told me that I was standing between him
and success. I didn’t mind scolding, but when he
was hurt—Well, at last I gave the hint he begged
for, and I’ve been eating my heart out ever since.
Now that you know, I’ll feel better, and of course
I’ll go right away now; not wait till Christmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“Just a moment, Miss Adair. I do not think we
should be weak, any of us; it is the ideal to be granite
shafts of principle, but the sweeter and truer the
woman, the harder for her to resist the sort of plea
made you. I can see that it was hard; if it had not
cost you pain to yield you would not be confessing
your misstep to me now. I must forgive it, Miss
Adair; it was a hard pull, and I’ll credit you with
resistance. It has not harmed me, you’ll be glad to
know. I wondered, rather, why there were noticeable
sales of that stock on a recent date; your lover
must have had considerable to invest in it. That
chapter is closed; put it out of your mind. Now,
my child, you were sent me by my brother, as a
friend, in a sense, of my niece Jeanette’s, and I
have a greater interest in you than that of a mere
employer. Will you let me express it in a question?
You have spoken of your engagement, your
marriage, in the past tense. Are you not still engaged,
still to be married at Christmas?” Mr. Lucas
asked his question gently, pity in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No, sir; it’s all over,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Not because of this franchise matter? You’re
not a morbid girl to do penance, and punish a man
for a thing of that sort?” cried Mr. Lucas.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Lucas,” said Cis. “Rod was married;
I could not marry him. He was splendid; he told
me about it. He was not going to tell me, but I love
everything straight so much that after all he told
me. And then we could not be married, you see.
It was splendid; Rod was good, but still I could not
go on with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“Go on with it? Rod was splendid, you say? To
tell you, to <i>tell</i> you he was married, after he had entrapped
you into an engagement, into loving him as
I see you loved him? Well, hardly splendid! He
did stop short of crime, but to stop on the edge of
bigamy, and to make a girl like you suffer! I’d
hardly call that splendid!” cried Mr. Lucas fiercely.</p>

<p>“Bigamy?” repeated Cis. “Well, I don’t believe
they call it that, but of course it is, if you stop to
think. I hadn’t thought about it just that way. Rod
was divorced; his wife was worse than dead, but she
wasn’t dead. I suppose it is bigamy.”</p>

<p>The word seemed to hold a horrid fascination for
Cis.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas fell back in his chair and stared at Cis,
trying to get his bearings.</p>

<p>“Divorced?” he echoed. “Oh, but, my girl, that’s
another matter! Of course remarriage is not bigamy
when the state has freed a man. Then he has no
wife, so his marriage to a second one is not bigamy;
it is as if the first one were dead.”</p>

<p>Cis shook her head. “No, Mr. Lucas,” she said,
“it really isn’t; how could it be? Suppose I were
walking with Rod, had married him, and we met
his first wife. It wouldn’t be the same as if she were
dead, would it? There’d be two of us, both alive.
How do you suppose I’d feel; how would any decent
girl feel? Besides, Mr. Lucas, Rod was married
by a priest, and no one can break those marriages.
I’d have had to give up God to marry Rod,
and how could I?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas frowned angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“It’s that abominable Roman tyranny again,” he
cried. “How in the name of all that’s sane do those
priests get hold of minds the way they do? You
poor little victim of man-made laws, posing for Divine
ones, have you wrecked your life and a man’s
life for this nonsense?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Lucas,” said Cis with a weary little gasp
for breath, but not in the least shaken. “You are
ever so much wiser than I, but I know that is not
true. Our Lord Himself said that a divorced person
could not be married, and what can you do
when He tells you anything? I think I can see why
it has to be, because outside the Catholic Church
people keep going in and out of marriages till you’d
think they’d be dizzy. And then there are the
children. No, Mr. Lucas, it’s all right, even though
it hurts. And, anyway, how could I turn my back
on the Church? God’s there.”</p>

<p>“You told me once that you were—what’s their
term for it?—an indifferent Catholic. That you
weren’t devout like some friend of yours, or was it
Jeanette Lucas? Yet you make the choice of your
Church instead of your happiness! I see what it
has cost you; your face betrays your suffering. You,
who could not stand firm against your lover’s pleading
to you to put him in the way of making money,
only of making money; who did violence to your
hatred of not ‘being square,’ as you put it, you leave
him, throw him over, infuriate him, wound his
pride, as well as his love of you—for no man would
do less than curse a woman for thus failing him
after he had let her have the chance to choose—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
for an idea; for allegiance to a system; to keep
within a Church which was not especially dear to
you! And this when the laws of your country
would justify your choosing the man, would place
their seal upon your position in society as his wife!
My heavens, Cicely Adair, what is it, what can it be
that can so mold you into a Christian martyr, singing
as the wild beasts rend her?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas sat erect, frowning heavily, his eyes
flashing, for the problem before him stirred him to
his depths. He had already encountered it in his
brother’s conduct; he resisted the one explanation
of it which his reason presented to him.</p>

<p>Cis smiled her pitiful, funny little shadow of her
normal bright, amused smile, and looked up at Mr.
Lucas, saying:</p>

<p>“I’m not singing, Mr. Lucas, not so you’d notice
it! But I wouldn’t want the wild beasts to go off
and lie down, not if it would turn me back. You
see, it’s quite easy. I mean to understand. I’ve got
to stand by, if I want God to stand by me, and what
should I do if He didn’t? And that’s not all of it.
I love Rod, but God is different; you can’t get on
without Him. I think He’ll teach me to get on
without Rod, somehow. I suppose I had more faith
than I knew I had. It’s all faith, isn’t it, Mr.
Lucas?”</p>

<p>“Yes! It is all faith, Cicely Adair!” cried Mr.
Lucas, springing to his feet. “You’ve testified to
yours! I don’t mind telling you that I think it is a
great thing that you have done. I suppose I’m intelligent
enough to recognize what the loose marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
laws are doing in this country. As a lawyer I
know their effect on morals, the stability of home,
the legitimacy of children. But that a slip of a girl
should willingly throw over her strong love, her
dearest hopes; a poor, pitiful little bead of clay set
herself against the mighty torrent of evil, all because
a Church tells her to, promises her heaven if
she does—good Lord! We Episcopalians discountenance
divorce, but our ministers may or may not
marry divorced people, according as they are
minded. The opposition of bishops and clergy to
their doing so is straw, because there is nothing to
enforce it, but you, who were not devout, you embrace
your hard lot at the bidding of your priests!
As there is a God above us, Cicely Adair, what is
the power of Rome that still can make confessors
and martyrs of soft virgins?”</p>

<p>“The God above us, isn’t it, Mr. Lucas?” said
Cicely.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas stared at her a moment, then he said:</p>

<p>“And now it turns you into an apologist! Your
answer covers all sides of the question, admitting a
premise! And the premise almost annihilates the
necessity of admission! I will look into it—” He
checked himself quickly, and said with a change of
voice: “You will stay on in my employ, Miss Adair?
You will not now leave me at Christmas? Do you
feel fit to resume your desk to-day?”</p>

<p>“I came to work, Mr. Lucas, if you don’t mind
having me after I told the secret—”</p>

<p>“A closed book!” Mr. Lucas interrupted her,
raising his hand prohibitively. “I’m not afraid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the honor that would not let you rest till you had
acknowledged your weakness. I hardly think that
what I know of you would justify my doubting your
fidelity.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Lucas. You are as good as you
can be to me! I’ll go to work then, now. May I
have till New Year’s to decide how long I’ll be
here?” asked Cis, going over to put her hat and coat
away, and then dropping into her desk chair.</p>

<p>“New Year’s will be time enough to decide,”
said Mr. Lucas, also resuming his desk chair. To
himself he said, with an inward smile: “I wonder if
that glowing hair was given her for a nimbus?
There are easier martyrdoms than hers!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

GOOD-BYE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS pleasant to come out from the great office
building at half past four to find waiting a
motor coupé of the most correct and up-to-date
type. It was still pleasanter to find the car door
held open by a small hand in a grey glove that managed,
in spite of its smallness and other occupation,
to give a welcoming pat with two fingers on Cicely’s
shoulder as she entered the car; to meet a warm
smile in a pair of appraising eyes, and hear a beautiful
voice say heartily:</p>

<p>“Well, child, the morning and the evening were
the first day! Was this first one hard, or was it
rather agreeable to pick up the threads again?”</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Cis had a sense of
belonging, and it warmed her with a thrill of actual
pleasure, the perception that in spite of all and
after all, it might be good to be alive.</p>

<p>What a beautiful thing this elderly gentlewoman
was doing, Cis thought, thus to feed the hungry!
There were many who limited that corporal work
of mercy strictly to its proper bounds; few who fed
the hungry of heart, mind, and soul in Miss Braithwaite’s
way, and yet it was more like feeding than it
was like a ministration to the soul. To take Cis
into her home, to warm her into renewed life, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
open up to her hitherto unknown resources for the
maintenance of life’s true values, this was Miss
Braithwaite’s divinely inspired dealing with Cis.
The girl knew that Miss Braithwaite was an aristocrat
to her finger tips, exclusive in her friendships,
withdrawn by instinct; that she wisely and justly
chose those whom she would admit into her home.
How fine it was then to fly at once to the rescue of
Cicely Adair at the summons of Father Morley,
mothering her as he had asked her to! Plainly,
Cicely Adair must repay this goodness by its success
with her; she must be good and happy; put
away grief; grow in the directions which Miss
Braithwaite indicated. Now that, for all the rest of
the winter, Cis was to be an inmate of this ideal
home—well, after all and in spite of all, Cis ought
not to find her share of the days hard to fulfill.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite would not let Cis tell her anything
of the events of her day during dinner.</p>

<p>“Dinner should be eaten to the accompaniment
of chat, but not of long, nor of too absorbing tales,
my dear,” she declared in her crisp little dogmatic
way, half-amused with herself, yet entirely in earnest
as to her dictum. “You will not eat properly
if you recount to me the history of Mr. Wilmer
Lucas and his reception of his secretary’s confession
of crime! I know perfectly well that your
wishbone will not be scraped clean if you are too
absorbed in talk—it is chicken to-night! Beside the
hearth, Cis; that’s the place for a long narrative!
The table for brief comments and flashes of wit.
At the table I disapprove of discussions, monologues,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
anything that too greatly distracts from the
business in hand!”</p>

<p>Later, “beside the hearth,” Miss Braithwaite
handed Cis the tongs, and lay back in her deep
chair with a breath of content. She looked like
some sort of bird, tiny, alert, her quick, keen eyes
flashing behind the eyeglasses resting on her thin
arched nose; her hands making sudden small movements
characteristic of them, not unlike the uplifting
of a wing, its outspread and infolding.</p>

<p>“There are times that I doubt my own nobility
of soul, Cicely Adair,” she said, her mobile lips
twisting with a tiny mocking smile. “But when I’m
before the hearth fire, and hand someone else the
tools to stir and mend it, then I know that I am fit
to rank with the noblest Roman matron! Perhaps
I mean Roman ladies living in the catacombs; I’ve
no doubt that they were more self-sacrificing than
the Mother of the Gracchi and the rest of ’em! Do
lift that log end, Cis! It’s wasting there, smoldering
out; make it blaze.”</p>

<p>Cis obediently lifted the charred end of a log into
the heart of the fire, and then, at: “Now tell me!”
from Miss Braithwaite, told her story of Mr. Lucas’
reception of her confession to him, and his comments
on her obedience to her conscience.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite sat erect as she listened, her
face expressing her interest.</p>

<p>“My dear child, you never can tell!” she cried
as Cis ended. “Robert Lucas became a Catholic
about ten years after I did; he is fifteen years
younger than I. Wilmer Lucas was no less disgusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
than he was angry. He said that Robert
had made a fool of himself, that with his mind
continually hovering over kisses upon the pope’s
toe he never could get anywhere, amount to
anything! Wilmer always enjoyed vigorous symbolical
language! In point of fact Robert Lucas
has gone far, has amounted to a great deal. He is
not involved in national politics, as our lawyer Wilmer
is, but he is a successful man, and no one ever
speaks of him without paying tribute in the highest
terms to his lofty character. Wilmer Lucas is honorable
and honored, but it is Robert, not he, whose
goodness seems to impress people over and above
his other qualities. Wilmer Lucas has been most
intolerant of the Church all these years; he is
protestant, not only against her directly, but against
her intrusion into his family. He is exceedingly
fond of Robert’s daughter Jeanette, by the way. I
have always seen that in the case of Father Morley,
whom he avoids; my own case; his unwillingness to
allow his brother ever to speak on the subject, Wilmer
Lucas betrays his perception of the impregnable
position of the Old Church, that he pays her
tribute, though it is in a form not unlike the tribute
to her Founder recorded in the Gospel. He is a
man of logical mind, highly trained to sift evidence;
he cannot fail to perceive the immense difference
between her consistent logic and the shifting sands
of mere opinion outside of her, nor can he account
for her hold on men’s souls down through the ages
by natural means. Now, to-day, you have startled
him by a new instance of the power of conscience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
I am glad that you look pale, Cis dear, that you
show suffering! And how it must have impressed
him that, though you could not withstand Rodney’s
pleading with you to do what you held wrong in a
lesser matter, you have held your Faith against all
pressure from without and within! Evidently Mr.
Lucas is impressed, the more so that he had not
thought you particularly devout. Perhaps it will
set him thinking, farther and hard! As I set out by
saying, you never can tell!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Braithwaite, it isn’t likely that Mr.
Lucas would pay attention long to no-consequence
me!” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“You—never—can—tell!” repeated Miss Braithwaite
emphatically. “Usually a train of circumstances,
some of them trivial and hardly noted, lead
men to the Truth; it is like a sort of Divine hare-and-hounds;
tiny scraps of paper flutter along the
trail, unconsciously seen by the players, till at last!
The goal and the game won!”</p>

<p>“That’s great, Miss Braithwaite!” cried Cis with
quick appreciation of the figure. “I wish I were
that sort of a scrap of paper, but it’s not likely.”</p>

<p>“Never can tell!” Miss Braithwaite harped on
her premise. “I’ve always noticed that when God
breaks us, my dear, it’s to use the pieces in new
combinations, and for good. It is as if we were picture
puzzles, with reverse sides. We’re something
quite pretty at first; then the pieces are tossed and
displaced by a great experience, and, if we submit
and wait, behold God’s Hand puts us all together
again, the reverse side up, and the picture is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
longer merely a pretty thing, but a beautiful, shining
illumination, of which all who run may read
its meaning which is at once a magnet and a map
of the way.”</p>

<p>“Miss Braithwaite, you tell me wonderful
things!” cried Cis softly. “If I’m here all winter
with you I ought to amount to something; I’ll try to.
It’s strange that I don’t hear—from Rodney. Do
you suppose he isn’t going to say one word to me? I
was sure he’d try to see me. Do you think he’s
given right up like this?”</p>

<p>“From my experience of men I’d say decidedly
not,” said Miss Braithwaite. “However, it is strange
that he makes no sign. Perhaps he’s the exception;
that his anger will prevent him from claiming to
hear his verdict from your lips, but very few men
would submit to banishment on the strength of a
brief note from you.”</p>

<p>“I will not see him; he can’t hear the verdict
from my lips!” cried Cis. “What would be the
use? Only miserable pain; parting all over again.
I’m so afraid of meeting him! You can’t drive me
everywhere I go. I truly think I ought to leave
Beaconhite; I think perhaps I must.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, we’ll see! Not to-night, at least!
To-morrow is also a day. I like those wise old sayings.
I hope that you may stay on; you need Father
Morley for a while. Yes, Ellen; someone to see
me?” Miss Braithwaite turned toward her maid, entering
with a card on a small salver.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Braithwaite, for Miss Adair. He—the
caller—was determined to walk right in, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
made him go into the reception room,” said Ellen,
who, like most good and faithful servants, was perfectly
conversant with household affairs; took care
that whatever happened under the roof should, in
some way, transpire to her.</p>

<p>“Miss Braithwaite, see him! Hide me! I can’t,
I can’t!” gasped Cis, snatching at the card, instantly
dropping it and looking wildly around.</p>

<p>“G. Rodney Moore,” Miss Braithwaite read. “Go
out that door, Cis; I’ll see him. Ellen, take Miss
Adair through the little passage to the back stairs.
Then go down and show Mr. Moore up here. Be
quiet, Cicely; this is your last trial, my dear. Go
up and say your beads and fear not, my child.”</p>

<p>Cis escaped, hurrying away, yet everything in her
called upon her to stay. An instant, and she could
see Rodney; a word, and they would never part.</p>

<p>Rodney Moore came half stumbling into Miss
Braithwaite’s library. He found that little lady
standing to receive him beside her hearth; the position
of the chairs told him that she had not been
long alone.</p>

<p>Although Miss Braithwaite had never seen Rodney
Moore before, she recognized upon his face,
in his disordered clothes, the marks of unhappy
disturbance of mind. He stopped short seeing her,
and said:</p>

<p>“I want Cicely Adair.”</p>

<p>“I know you do,” said Miss Braithwaite, and
there was pity in her voice. “Sit down, Mr. Moore.
Miss Adair has asked me to see you for her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
will not be able to endure anything more than she
has borne.”</p>

<p>“The devil she won’t!” burst out Rodney. “What
about me? I don’t count, eh? She can write me a
cool note and expect that to satisfy the man who
saw her last in the place he was fitting up for her to
live in with him? Not much! I’d have been here
before, but I didn’t know where she was. She left
me; walked off like an oyster, with no heart nor
tongue in it, and, when I tried to connect with her,
she was gone. They couldn’t tell me anything about
her at her boarding house. I found out that was
the truth, too, and then I went off to see her old
friend, Nan Dowling; I was sure she had run off
to her, but no one had seen her there. I read all
the papers—you know what I was afraid I’d see in
one of ’em! I came back here, half crazy with
fear, and I found that damned cool, calm note waiting
for me, my ring in it! That Holly ring! So
here I am. Bring Cis here. I’ve a right to see her.
Don’t you try to keep her off!”</p>

<p>“Miss Adair was in this room when your card was
brought up, Mr. Moore. She ran away, praying me
to keep you from her; she will not see you. It is
she, not I, who decides,” said Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>“You lie!” cried Rodney hoarsely. “Do you suppose
I don’t know Cis? Nothing cold-hearted
about her! I’ll go through this house till I find her,
and when I find her—” He stopped, unable to go
on; he had risen, and stood holding to the back of
a chair, as if he might flay Miss Braithwaite with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“You will remain precisely where you are until
you leave my house,” said the tiny woman quietly.
“You will not step your foot beyond the boundary
to which I admit you. You do well to threaten me,
and to threaten a suffering girl whom you love! Be
seated, Mr. Moore, and listen to me. I am truly
sorry for you; it is hard, harder for you than for
Cicely, for she suffers for a righteous cause, and you
suffer because you are a traitor to that cause.”</p>

<p>“None of your sermons!” cried Rodney. “If I
hated the Roman Catholic Church before, and was
glad I was shunt of it, how do you suppose I like it
now that it is stealing my wife? Cis is a girl; girls
are easy fooled; they’re all alike when it comes to
priests and stuff. I could have held my tongue and
married Cis; this is what I get for being straight
with her. Is that fair?”</p>

<p>“You could not have married Cis; you might
have succeeded in ruining her life. Be thankful
that you had the grace to stop at the crime you contemplated
toward her,” Miss Braithwaite said. “But
I truly believe, Mr. Moore, that this is not all that
you get for being straight. I believe that good is
coming to you, unforeseen good, because you conquered
the temptation to trick her into a legal marriage
that never in her eyes—nor at the last issue in
yours, either—would have been a marriage. For so
mighty is truth, so strong its hold upon us, that we
can never free our souls from its blessed bondage.
Our lips and our actions may deny it; what we have
been taught persists in our souls, often saving us, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
last. Now do one last, fine, atoning act: go away
and leave Cis to find her way back into peace. You
say she wrote you calmly, coldly. I saw the note
written, there, at that desk. She wrote it in agony.
Surely you could read agony there if you were not
blinded with your own pain! Pain, but also anger,
Mr. Moore! Remember your pang is partly the
wrath of defeat.”</p>

<p>“See here, I’m not calling on you. You may be
a duchess, which you act like, but I’m not your
serf!” cried Rodney. “I won’t take this from you.
Cis has to refuse to see me. Send her here. How
do I know you haven’t got her locked up somewhere,
you and a priest?”</p>

<p>“Because you are not a fool,” said Miss Braithwaite
contemptuously. “Take a sheet of paper
from that desk, at which Cicely sat to write to you,
and write upon it any message you please. My maid
shall take it to her. After that, if she will not see
you, you will leave my house and I trust be man
enough to torment the girl no more.”</p>

<p>“You’re a high-handed little labor leader, if you
are a fine lady, aren’t you?” cried Rodney, almost
admiringly, in spite of his rage.</p>

<p>He crossed the room, took up a piece of paper
from the desk, shook down the ink in his own fountain
pen, and wrote several lines. Then he took an
envelope, laid his note inside and sealed it.</p>

<p>“Servants are curious,” he said. “Are you going
to call yours?”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite rang, and Ellen appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Please take Mr. Moore’s note to Miss Adair, Ellen,”
said Miss Braithwaite. “Wait till she has read
it, and bring back her reply, please.”</p>

<p>“No! I’ll go with you! Take me—I’ll follow
you, Ellen; go ahead,” said Rodney, starting toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Rodney Moore, you forget yourself! Stay where
you are. Ellen, do as I have told you; this young
man will wait here for your return.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite drew herself up to her full five
feet of height, but there was in her eyes and voice
that which no one ever lightly disobeyed. Muttering
something, Rodney fell back, and stood beside
the library table, fumbling the magazines upon it
with shaking hands.</p>

<p>There was perfect silence in the room for a
strained quarter of an hour of waiting. A log on
the fire broke and fell apart; Rodney jumped, his
nerves quivering from sleepless nights and days of
baffled will, together with fear as to Cicely’s fate.
Then Ellen returned and handed back to Rodney
the note which he had sent to Cis. Upon it she had
written, almost illegibly, across the final page:</p>

<p>“Rod, dear, I can’t see you, truly I can’t. It would
be harder for us both. I would give up anything on
earth for you, but I will not give up God for you.
Please, Rod, don’t try to see me, never, oh, never!
And please, please, Rod dear, not so much forgive
me as say to yourself: Poor Cis—Holly was right.
It is right to serve God first. And be a good boy
yourself, Rod, my beloved, and come back, too, so
that after a few little years we’ll be together forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
and ever. But till then, please let this be good-bye.
Cis.”</p>

<p>Rodney crushed the poor little note in the palm
of his hand, then he smoothed it out, laying it flat
on his hand. Then he looked down on it, standing
quite still. Then he bent down to it and kissed it.
Miss Braithwaite knew that the long, silent waiting
for it; the reaction from his harrowing fear, now
that he knew Cis was safe; his proximity to her; his
better self, perhaps the graces of his boyhood, had
conquered. Rodney had struck his colors and accepted
defeat.</p>

<p>“This settles it, Miss Braithwaite,” he said.
“There’s nothing more to hang around for. You are
right; Cis decides it herself. I beg your pardon for
my impertinence, but—”</p>

<p>“I shall not remember it, Mr. Moore; you have
been sorely tried. I do not wonder that your nerves
snapped. Will you let me say to you that with all
my heart I wish you well? Happy, too, though I
know the word sounds mocking in your ears to-night?”
Miss Braithwaite’s voice was exceedingly
kind; her heart went out to Rodney, whose state
was immeasurably more to be pitied than Cicely’s.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Rod miserably. “It does sound
what you might call far-fetched. You might tell
Cicely, if you will, that I’m going away; I won’t stay
in Beaconhite. I haven’t the heart to stay; I’d be
always looking along the streets for her. Tell her
I’ll stick with the same concern, and, if she ever
needed me for anything, to address me in care of
Hammersley and Rhodes, Chicago. That’s the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
office, and they’ll forward anything. Good night,
Miss Braithwaite. Is Cis staying with you long?”</p>

<p>“I hope all winter,” said Miss Braithwaite. “It’s
only fair to her to tell you that she has gone
through utter agony; her victory over herself has
been hard won, so don’t underrate it, and try to see
the value of eternal things, if such a girl as our
Cicely Adair can turn from joy and love for their
sake. Cis could not go to you into the wrong; come
to her into the right. And God bless you, poor
lad.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Rodney again. “I’m done with
Church, but I’m much obliged; you mean it well.
I hope Cis will stay on; you’ll look after her. I
don’t understand how she came to be here; I suppose
you’re one of these befriending women. Good-bye.
Tell Cis—No! What’s the use? You can’t
send messages that do any good. I wish I could kiss
her good-bye. She’s—she’s a wonder! Oh, good
God, what’s the use? Good-bye, Miss Braithwaite.”</p>

<p>Rodney turned and dashed toward the door. He
collided with the end of the bookcase nearest it, fell
back, begged its pardon, and with a second dash
was gone. Miss Braithwaite drew a long breath,
and turned toward the fire, picking up the tongs to
mend it, under the necessity of action; she was considerably
disturbed.</p>

<p>“It’s most wearing to have love affairs, even by
proxy,” she told herself. “He’s not without attraction,
and I can see that he’s remarkably handsome
when he has slept, and eaten, and shaved. Dear me,
what a singular thing it is that with all the millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
of people there are in the world one can become so
vitally necessary to another that the loss of him—or
her—is cataclysmic in effect! I wonder how the
saints endure all the human disturbances unloaded
upon them for their help! I find it exhausting. But
then I have not died, and thus gained the larger
point of view! And, furthermore, it’s barely possible
that I’m not a saint! Now for my poor Cis!
I can imagine her state with Rod downstairs and
her polarized will holding her upstairs, forever separated,
yet with but twenty-five feet between
them!”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite went upstairs. She found Cis on
her knees at the balustrade, her face pressed to the
spindles, which her fingers tightly clasped.</p>

<p>It was a wet face that she raised to Miss Braithwaite,
but she was glad to see it so; tears were healing.</p>

<p>“I heard his voice; I saw him go out, Miss Braithwaite!
He will never come to me again! Oh, Miss
Braithwaite, Miss Braithwaite!” Cis sobbed.</p>

<p>“Well, as to that,” began Miss Braithwaite in a
customary formula of hers, as she lifted Cis gently
to her feet and led her into her chamber, “I’m not
so sure. You see, even though we live only about
seventy years, it’s amazing the things that can happen
in that time, things which we declared impossible!
I have a notion that you may not be through
with Rodney Moore, and his affairs, but I doubt
that they will always mean to you as much as they
do now. He behaved well, my dear—at the last!
I’m bound to say that he seemed ready for personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
violence upon me at first. He accepted your decision
completely, quietly, and nicely. He told me to
say to you that he was leaving Beaconhite, but may
be reached through the main office of his firm in
Chicago if ever he could serve you. And that is behaving
prettily, my dear, and it is a real relief to us
not to dread your meeting him. So now, my Cicely,
will you go to bed and to sleep, resting peacefully
on your knowledge that your fight is fought, your
victory won, and that God is tenderly blessing your
true heart with the love of His Heart?”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite left Cis on her pillow in her
pretty room, ready to sleep from weariness, relaxed,
as Miss Braithwaite had suggested to her, by the
knowledge that this chapter in her life was closed.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs Miss Braithwaite met Mr.
Anselm Lancaster, just coming to call upon her;
they were great friends.</p>

<p>“You look tired, dear Miss Miriam,” he said at
once as they shook hands. “Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“No; on the contrary, something wholly right,”
she replied, leading the way into the library. “I’ve
been watching the Great Cable strain, but, thank
God, it has held, and I know a little bark that has
all sails set for the Beautiful Land.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

ORIENTATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW, my dear, you must turn toward the east
when you say your prayers,” Miss Braithwaite
briskly said to Cis the next morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>Cis smiled inquiringly, missing her meaning; it
was one of Miss Braithwaite’s highest assets that her
meanings were not always obvious; they stimulated
curiosity and held attention.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you really mean that I’m to turn
to the east?” Cis said.</p>

<p>“You are to face the coming day, keep your eyes
on the rising sun, your back resolutely turned on
the setting day,” explained Miss Braithwaite. “That
is called orientation, and it is your best attitude
now. Indeed I don’t know anyone who can afford
to take any other—eyes toward the orient ‘whence
comes the light.’” Cis was considering this hint
from Miss Braithwaite all day.</p>

<p>“Anyone else would tell me to brace up, or let
bygones be bygones, or something of that sort, but
Miss Braithwaite gives everything she says a turn
that makes you begin to do what she advises, even
while you’re listening to her,” she thought. “I’ll
look eastward! I’ll wear blinders so I can’t see, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
straight ahead! But I’ll be glad when Christmas
is over.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite involved Cis in preparations for
a Christmas totally unlike any that she had hitherto
known. There was to be a tree for her “scalawags,”
and it was not hard to interest Cis in this. She went
with Miss Braithwaite to see her little ragged boys,
and capitulated to them at once, as they did to her.
It refreshed Cis to play with them, to talk to them,
falling back on the vernacular which she had
learned from her newsboys in those old days, hourly
becoming more and more unreal to her. There was
a small, peaked lame little creature of nine who
won and wrung Cis’s heart. She immediately began
a glorious warm crimson sweater for him, on which
she knit frantically every evening when she was not
oversewing tarlatan candy bags with bright worsteds,
or assembling and gluing into place the figures
for the little, but perfect “Cribs” which each
child within Miss Braithwaite’s orbit was to receive
to take home at Christmas. She would set up a
“Bethlehem” in wretched places, far enough removed
in squalor and vicious ignorance from the
light of the Star, the chant of the angels.</p>

<p>Every one of Father Morley’s girls in his club
was to receive a book and some of the useless,
pretty things which girls covet.</p>

<p>“It’s downright brutal to give only utilitarian
things at Christmas!” declared Miss Braithwaite.
“It’s a joyous time, and who can be joyous over
black stockings and initialed handkerchiefs? The
girls must have nonsensical things; dangling, silly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
vanity-feeders along with their substantial gifts
from Father Morley, else Merry Christmas would
be mockery said to them.”</p>

<p>She put Cis at assorting these gifts, and, being a
girl herself who was to be but twenty-two on this
same Christmas, she enjoyed her task.</p>

<p>Mr. Lancaster often dropped in after dinner, and
not infrequently to dine. They all three drew up
before the vast hearth, with its jolly fire lighting up
Cicely’s red hair, turning it to gold-with-copper-alloy
on its surface coils; making a dark warmth
below its surfaces, like a low fire on a forge.</p>

<p>Cis did not talk much, but she listened, and, listening,
found new worlds opening out before her.
Both Miss Braithwaite and Mr. Lancaster had been
much about Europe; they knew unfrequented corners
of it as one knows the places beloved in childhood.</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Anselm?” Miss Braithwaite
would begin, and then would follow eager reminiscences
of dear, queer, crooked streets; a shrine in
a cathedral; a room in an ancient palace, or, more
delightful still, a sleeping village and the sweet
ways of its peasants all informed with faith, the
realization of God, and utter trust in Him.</p>

<p>Or Mr. Lancaster would exclaim: “Oh, Miss
Miriam, do you recall that little wounded kid which
we saw the summer you and I met in the Tyrol, and
how its sad-eyed little owner carried it—at such an
effort!—out to the Calvary on the hillside, and laid
it at the foot of the crucifix? There was faith that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
the God Who suffered to save souls would also pity
His small four-footed creatures!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I could not easily forget it, Anselm! It
was so sweet, and so piteous,” Miss Braithwaite had
answered. “I’ve always been most thankful that
you came along just then! I am sure that there is
one young creature in Switzerland who will carry
to the grave the conviction that, together with the
guardian angels, Americans are the instruments of
God’s mercy in answer to prayer! What a happy
child that was when you bound up the kid and set
its leg!”</p>

<p>Cicely, sitting silent on her side of the fireplace,
raised her eyes and met Mr. Lancaster’s look, like a
boy’s who has been found out in gentleness, always
more mortifying to an American lad than detection
in naughtiness—together with her impressions of
life amid venerable, yet vividly existent faith, she
was getting the revelation of two beautiful souls,
the elderly woman’s, the twenty-seven years
younger man’s, who knew and loved these things
because they were part of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes something came up in these desultory,
aimless talks which made Mr. Lancaster spring
up, take a book from the shelves—Miss Braithwaite
seemed to know exactly where to send him
for any volume of the three thousand or so in this
room—turn to a passage or a poem bearing on what
had just been said, and read it aloud.</p>

<p>This was almost the best of all. Anselm Lancaster
had a beautiful, flexible voice; he had been
an Oxford man and had brought home with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
the perfect modulations and pronunciation of English
which Oxford gives her sons, and he read with
the feeling that an artist and lover of literature
brings to a book. Cis, listening, felt that her education
was just beginning; she realized what Miss
Braithwaite had meant when she suggested to her
that she should spend this winter in this way. Heretofore
she had learned facts; now she was learning
what the facts stood for, what had called them into
being, and no array of facts can compare with this
knowledge. It is the clothing of the dry bones
which are meaningless until the spirit prophesies to
them and makes them alive.</p>

<p>Best of all, though, were those times when Anselm
Lancaster went over to Miss Braithwaite’s
piano, standing with its narrow end toward a book-filled
corner, its keyboard toward the room, and,
there in the shadow, played such exquisite music
that it obliterated conscious thought, leaving no
room for anything but the delight of harmonies. It
was hard to go on working at these times. Miss
Braithwaite’s work would fall into her lap, her face
rest upon her hand while she gazed into the fire
with eyes that seemed to look beyond the bounds
of flesh, her expression unutterably wistful. Cis,
who did not understand what she heard as Miss
Braithwaite did, yet was engulfed by it. Never in
her short life had anything so seized her as did this
music, yet, while in the elder woman it woke the
longing that nothing on earth can satisfy, in the
girl it called out new resolution to live and to do.</p>

<p>Cis talked little during these pleasant evenings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
yet she never felt, nor was excluded. Miss Braithwaite’s
smile was always ready for her; Mr. Lancaster
included her with small services rendered
her as she worked, and his eyes rested upon her
as he talked, leaving her free to reply or not as she
chose, and thus she, though silently for the most
part, made a third in the conversation.</p>

<p>On the eve of Christmas Eve Mr. Lancaster came
rather later than usual; Cis had decided that he was
not coming and was a little disappointed. She was
restless; it was hard to keep her fingers steadily employed,
her mind off the thought that the morrow
would have been her wedding day. Somewhere
Rod was remembering this. She sent a prayer out
toward him wherever he might be, that he might be
blessed.</p>

<p>When Mr. Lancaster came in Miss Braithwaite
was more than usually glad to see him.</p>

<p>“Welcome indeed, Anselm!” she cried. “I am
glad to see you, I heartily detest telephoning, but I
must arrange the details of our Christmas with you.
You know that the Jesuits have High Mass at midnight?
Father Morley needed persuading to it, but
he yielded to our clamor for it. My ragamuffins
have their tree to-morrow, at five in the afternoon—though
I don’t suppose you’d have suspected me
of the morning five o’clock! As you’re to be my
Santa Claus, you’ll meet me at the hall, I suppose?
The tree should be all over by seven. Then you’ll
come home with us; we’ll have a cozy dinner—<i>maigre</i>,
for the vigil!—and quietly wait for the
time to start for Mass. I’ll drive you and Cis; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
maids are to be sent in another car. Then, after
Mass, we’ll wish one another a blessed Noël, and
Cicely a birthday of the best gifts, and go our ways
to our well-merited slumber. Do you like my programme?”</p>

<p>“Only an ingrate could say no, Miss Miriam,”
cried Anselm Lancaster. “I’ll do my best to fulfil
my part of it. I’ve an idea! Do you mind if I
costume as St. Nicholas, instead of Santa Claus, and
tell the boys in a few simple words who I am, what
I’ve always done for children, and, in a word, what
a fine thing it is to have a saint for their friend, instead
of a fake? I think I can get it over to them,
and it’s rather a chance to steer them toward realities.
What says the great little lady? And her
lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“The great little lady highly approves, Anselm;
it takes you to see chances to bolster up faith and
morals incidentally to a frolic!” cried Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>“And—?” hinted Mr. Lancaster, waiting for Cis.
“The lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“If I’m the great little lady’s lieutenant, she
thinks it’s fine,” Cis said. “It will be good for me,
too, because I don’t know much about St. Nicholas,
except that somehow he stood for Santa Claus’
portrait, and it didn’t come near the original.
Queer, but I never liked Santa Claus as well as
other children did; he’s too fa-stout! I hated that
line that told about his shaking when he trotted
around! Maybe I’d have liked him better if I’d
been one of a family, and a lot of us had got acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
with him together, waiting for him to
come down the chimney.”</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster looked pleased at this unusually
long speech from Cis. Sometimes Cis wondered
if he knew her story and were sorry for her.
She did not mind if he knew, nor resent his possible
pity. He was so simply and truly a fine gentleman
that no knowledge that he possessed of another
could ever seem like an intrusion.</p>

<p>“Good! Then St. Nicholas appears, <i>permissu
superiorum</i>!” he cried. “Miss Braithwaite tells me
that you are to sing, Miss Adair; out of sight, impersonating
an angel, probably. I didn’t know you
sang.”</p>

<p>“I don’t; I’m just going to do it,” Cis laughed. “If
I impersonated an angel I’d be out of sight, that’s
sure!”</p>

<p>“In a slang sense?” suggested Mr. Lancaster.
“Will you sing now what you’ll sing then to the
children, please, Miss Cis!”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness!” sighed Cis, but she promptly
arose. “All right; I will. It’s the quickest way to
prove I can’t! But I can’t play; Miss Braithwaite
plays it.”</p>

<p>“Not when Anselm is here,” said Miss Braithwaite.
“Play ‘The Snow Lay on the Ground’; play
it in F, and harmonize it beautifully, because I intend
you to play it for Cis to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster sat down before the dark instrument
that reflected the fire and electric light in
its shining case. He struck a few chords meditatively,
then he went on to play the simple, lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
air over and over, surrounding it with new harmonies,
varying it, not as a fantasia, but by holding
to its simplicity, its lyric pathos, enriching it with
all the possibilities of a choral.</p>

<p>Cis stood listening, entranced.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that wonderful?” she sighed. “It’s all
there, and yet nothing is there till you bring it out!
I love that hymn!”</p>

<p>“There’s a pretty allegory tucked away in what
you just said, Miss Adair, if you look for it. Now
will you sing it for me?” said Mr. Lancaster, softly
touching the keys.</p>

<p>Cis sang, and Anselm Lancaster for the unnumbered
time in his knowledge of her, applauded
Miss Braithwaite’s wisdom. Cis had a fresh, true
young voice, round and sweet, with the quality in
it of a boy’s; she had no method whatever, but sang
as it had been given to her to sing, yet no artist
could better have conveyed the effect of an unearthly
narrator, telling the story of the First
Christmas. It was a song like the flow of a mountain
spring, or the shape of a northern pine, translated
into sound.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Adair, that was most beautiful!”
Anselm cried sincerely. “It is exactly what it should
be. You sound like one of the shepherd boys who
sing that hymn on the mountains beyond Rome, or
even like one of their pipes! And you speak every
word so that the dullest boy will get it.”</p>

<p>“I want them to know what it tells them,” said
Cis, and Mr. Lancaster noted that she made no disclaimer
of his praise, as she made no pose as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
singer. She did what she was asked to do as best
she could; there it began, there it ended.</p>

<p>“Of course they can’t understand the Latin,
<i>Venite adoremus Dominum</i>, but they are all baptized,
and I think we catch a little Latin then, don’t
you? It seems to stick to us. I know Latin never
seems like something I don’t understand, even
when I’m not understanding it, and at high school
it never bothered me a bit.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the Missal?” asked Anselm Lancaster,
interested in this Cis, suddenly friendly
toward him and at ease with him.</p>

<p>“Miss Braithwaite has been showing it to me, and
all about the colors, and the vestments’ meaning;
I’m so glad that she has!” cried Cis eagerly. “It’s
so splendid, so beautiful, so big and so old! It’s as
if I’d been a miserable little scrap of a beggar girl
and someone had taken me into a palace with rooms
and rooms, and told me it was all mine! Do you
know, Mr. Lancaster, it’s scandalous to confess it,
but I always thought there was just one Mass; every
day the same, three hundred and sixty-five times a
year. And here all these collects and prefaces—mercy!”</p>

<p>Cis waved her hands as she ended; her delight in
recovering her inheritance was unmistakable.</p>

<p>“Now I know what Santa—I mean St. Nicholas!—must
bring you!” cried Anselm Lancaster, exchanging
a glance of pleasure with Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>Weary, but triumphant, having brought “her
ragamuffins’ Christmas tree” to a successful conclusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
Miss Braithwaite took her guests home in her
coupé to dine on Christmas Eve. It was another Cis
from the one of the night before who sat, pale, with
drooping eyes, in her golden gown with its slender
line of brown fur, opposite to Mr. Lancaster, talking
little, eating indifferently, her face grave, rather
than sad, her smile sweet and ready, with a kind of
friendly patience new to Cis.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite saw that Anselm watched her,
and she, also, watched her covertly. The girl was
changing fast; she was growing, deepening, expanding.
At this rate she would soon be a gracious, attractive
and valuable woman.</p>

<p>A thought new to her mind occurred to Miss
Braithwaite, but she instantly dismissed it. Anselm
Lancaster had seen many lovely and lovable
women, in many lands; Cicely Adair could not attract
him beyond his sympathetic interest in a girl
who had done what she had done, had been faithful
to the cause nearest his heart.</p>

<p>And if Cicely had been capable of attracting such
a man as the scholarly and accomplished Anselm
Lancaster, he was so far from her thoughts in this
regard that she would never put forth the innocent
wiles which are every girl’s for the man whom she
feels may love her, by which she awakens and feeds
his attraction, according to the plan of the Creator
Who made them male and female. Cis withdrew
from Mr. Lancaster as a rule, as from one outside
her orbit, and when she approached him it was with
that admiration and trust that frankly announced
her sense of remoteness. Yet it was a sweet, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
womanly Cis, with new depths in her eyes, and
strength and goodness being graven upon her pale
face, who sat so quietly across from Anselm Lancaster
in her golden, brown-furred gown that Christmas
eve at dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner, as usual, Miss Braithwaite repaired
to her library fire. The night was cold; a sleet rain
was falling, turning to ice as it fell; the fire was welcome,
its warmth and its cheer needed.</p>

<p>“Anselm, before you begin to smoke, will you
call the garage? I detest telephoning. Tell Leo to
put the chains on my car, and not to fail to have it
here by half past eleven; I will not drive faster than
ten miles an hour to-night. Then you may light
your cigar, and draw up to be agreeable to us,” Miss
Braithwaite commanded her guest. “Cicely, dear,
is it to be for you an order that keeps perpetual
silence?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid no order, of any sort,” said Cis arousing
herself. “Fancy me not talking! But we went
to confession, you see, and after that I can’t say
much for awhile. I’m thinking about Nannie,
married to-morrow, and wondering what my birthday
resolutions ought to be.”</p>

<p>She spoke softly, sitting close beside Miss Braithwaite,
but Anselm Lancaster heard her low, yet
resonant voice.</p>

<p>He hung up the telephone receiver, and came
back to the hearth. As he slipped into his waiting
chair he laid on Cicely’s knee a package; evidently
a book.</p>

<p>She untied the cord and disclosed a translation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
of the Missal, bound in tooled red leather, three
ribbons hanging from its pages.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Cis rapturously. “Oh, Mr. Lancaster,
how fine, how beautiful! Is it—” She
checked herself, but, fluttering the leaves, her arrested
question was answered. On the fly page
was written in the close, small hand of one who
wrote and thought much: “Cicely Adair. Her Lord’s
birthday and her own. Christmas 1922.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you!” cried Cis. “You
can’t know how much I wanted it! Nor how I
thank you! Truly, Mr. Lancaster, I’m so grateful
I can’t say it. To think of your bothering with
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, my dear Miss Adair! I protest! <i>Bothering</i>
with you! How dreadful! And not <i>grateful</i>,
you know! Aren’t we friends? You must not be
grateful to a friend! But I hope you’ll like your
Missal; of course you will! Now I’m talking nonsense,
too! I wanted you to have it for the Midnight
Mass. You told me you’d never been to a
midnight Mass! It’s supremely beautiful; the
<i>Adeste</i>, and that fourth stanza at midnight: ‘<i>Ergo
qui natus die hodierna</i>.’ Will you say one tiny
prayer for the Missal-giver?” cried Anselm Lancaster,
so boyishly that Cis, as well as Miss Braithwaite
looked surprised, and Cis said with the greatest
friendliness, out of her own boyish side:</p>

<p>“I’ll say a big one! I’ll put you in with Miss
Braithwaite and Nan. I’m going to receive for
Nan; to-morrow is her wedding day. And someone
who needs it most of all. I’ll put you into my intention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
and if I mayn’t be grateful, Mr. Lancaster,
I’ll be entirely ungrateful, but I’ll think you’re so
good to me that I would be grateful if it weren’t terribly
wrong to be anything but ungrateful!”</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster threw back his head and
laughed aloud, and Miss Braithwaite joined him.
Cicely’s nonsense delighted her watchful friend; it
was a symptom of health. Anselm Lancaster had
never seen her mischievous; he found it delightful.</p>

<p>The church of St. Francis Xavier was crowded,
but pews were held till ten minutes after midnight,
and Miss Braithwaite had brought her two guests
thither ten minutes before midnight tolled out
from the clock on the adjoining house and school
building.</p>

<p>The Mass was beyond words solemn and beautiful:
the vestments of cloth of gold; the myriad
lights; the scent of forest and incense; the great
organ, the hundred choristers, the sublime music,
the <i>Adeste Fideles</i>, sung with such fervor that all
over the church people were sobbing with love for
this inexpressibly dear hymn. With this the Mass
marched on to its supreme moment, the greatest,
the most inconceivable, the one infinite action of
finite man, which encircles all creation, from Adam
to the last born at the consummation of the world,
performed in time, going on eternally.</p>

<p>Cicely was wrapt into something like ecstasy.
The Christmas eve which she had dreaded had become
the highest hour of joy which she had ever
known. She was swept beyond herself into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
rapture of the angels who first sang this Gloria to
which she listened.</p>

<p>God had tested her; she had not failed Him.
Now He was rewarding her with a reward beyond
her comprehension. She received this communion
with her face wet with tears of joy. At last, at last
she knew in Whom she had believed, blindly, yet
faithfully believed.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased when Mass was over; the
congregation came out into starlight and an ice-clad
world, shining under the light.</p>

<p>“Oh, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, dear,
dear Miss Braithwaite, Mr. Lancaster!” cried Cis
turning back on the lower step of the church with
radiant face. “Merry, merry, merry! For it’s
blessedly merry to be a Catholic on Christmas and
to be at Mass when the little Lord comes down!”</p>

THE NEW YEAR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS THERE are fifteen minutes between tides
when the ocean lies quiet at neither ebb nor
flow, so the world seems to rest between Christmas
and the New Year; preparations for holidays over,
active work not resumed.</p>

<p>Cis had decided to continue as Mr. Lucas’ secretary,
at least until spring. Affairs in which he was
interested had taken on sudden activity in ways and
directions which would have made it hard for him
to begin a new secretary at that time; entire fidelity
to him and complete silence as to what had to transpire
to his secretary were especially required now
in her who filled that office. Cis knew, in spite of
her lapse for Rod’s sake, that her successor might
easily bungle things, as she never would, or intentionally
talk, to her employer’s detriment. In view
of Mr. Lucas’ proved interest in her, Cis felt in
honor bound to stand by for the present, if she
could do so. Yet there was upon her a restlessness
of mind that impelled her to change, any change.
“It was growing pains,” Miss Braithwaite told her,
and Cis knew that she was right. She was growing,
and the expansion of her powers called to her to
give them scope.</p>

<p>Yet Cis was growing steadily happier in Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Braithwaite’s home, and she knew that Miss
Braithwaite thoroughly enjoyed having her there.
Her sense of humor, which never could long be
downed, was coming to the surface again; she made
her hostess laugh with chuckling delight over her
nonsense. Once more she was growing to be the
frank, boyish Cis, who was excellent company and
attractive to all sorts of people. With this revival
of her old charm, Cis was acquiring the charm of
one who lives intimately in the best companionship.
She read eagerly, with Miss Braithwaite to guide
her choice of books; she listened no less eagerly,
and began to share talk as valuable as her reading.
She met interesting people, and heard discussed
measures of great import, helpful to individuals
and to her country. She began to drift up to the
edges of these things and to help in them, ever so
little, but learning to do, to plan; being, unknown
to herself, inducted into the great things now waiting
on every hand for lay men and women to perform.</p>

<p>Father Morley came often to see Miss Braithwaite;
he relied on her acumen, her remarkable
powers for help in his undertakings. He, a tired
man, not particularly strong, delighted in the refreshment
he received in her restful library, from
her own wit and gracious talk; from her brain
which understood at a half word much that he
could not say. She put at his disposal all her resources
of talent and wealth and social position.</p>

<p>Father Morley was himself a person of rare cultivation
of mind; he had been an omnivorous reader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
from his childhood; his remarkable education
began long before his seminary days, exceeded textbooks.</p>

<p>He found Cis interesting; he recognized in her
that capacity to soar which so far surpasses the sufficient
goodness of excellent souls, and he made it
his affair to help Miss Braithwaite to hold up
Cicely’s opening wings. She grew deeply attached
to this tenderly kind, austere Jesuit, and yielded
herself gratefully to his molding.</p>

<p>Thus the winter swung into its steady pace after
the New Year, and Cis was amazed to find that her
days were not only peaceful, but full to overflowing,
and that they were happy. There was an ache
in her heart for Rodney; she did not forget, yet
being an honest Cis, she realized that if he were
to return to her he would not satisfy her as he had
done; that in severing herself from Rodney Moore
she had leaped over on to a height beyond him, and
that from that hour she had gone on ascending.</p>

<p>How strange it was that in doing right she had
gained in time the good that had been promised her
only for eternity! There was that ache in her
heart for Rodney—what woman would not mourn
a lost love, perhaps the more that she began to see
the loss in its true light—but the Cis who had been
for a quarter of a year the inmate of Miss Braithwaite’s
house, associated with her and her friends,
had grown beyond the girl who had been satisfied
with Rodney Moore.</p>

<p>As the winter evenings grew cold and drear, Anselm
Lancaster sought no less frequently the cheerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
fireside, the laden shelves, the grand piano of
Miss Braithwaite’s library; still more the delightful
fireside talk of its mistress, whom he admired
with all his might.</p>

<p>And Cis herself? Did he find her an attraction?
Sometimes Miss Braithwaite thought so, but Cis
surely did not. However, she had grown friendly
and at ease with Anselm Lancaster, chatted with
him, showed him her natural gifts, as well as the
supernatural ones developing in her; was her frank,
sunny self, and of course Anselm was not so stupid
as not to find her likable, admirable. But there
was no ground for seeing more in it than that, Miss
Braithwaite decided, perhaps with relief.</p>

<p>He talked to Cis of the things which interested
him; of his work, his plans. Of his home, which
he made a temporary home for those who had left
home and relatives for conscience’ sake, who
needed a foothold upon which to stand to catch
the breath of the new atmosphere when the old had
become too vitiated for them to continue to breathe
it. Of his Italian classes, his organized effort to
hold the immigrant against assault in the new land;
of all the ramifications of his lay army to fight
against Lucifer, the once-beautiful, the forever
subtle and attractive.</p>

<p>Cis listened enkindled.</p>

<p>“It is splendid, glorious!” she cried. “If I stay
in Beaconhite will you teach me how to do, and put
me at something? I’ve got to pay back, a little,
somehow!”</p>

<p>“You could do anything with the Italians, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
Adair. Will you study the language? It isn’t hard
to learn it. And you could do much else; you’re
a dynamic creature. But ‘<i>if</i> you stay in Beaconhite’?
Aren’t you sure of staying?” cried Mr. Lancaster.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” declared Cis. “I don’t know
what I may do, but this isn’t quite my own life. I
love Miss Braithwaite a little more each day; I’d
be thankful to go on here forever, if she needed me.
She is greater than any other woman; there’s just
one of her! But I don’t mean much here. I think
there must be a place for me somewhere that will
be my very own, something that I was meant to do.
Sometimes I think I’ll go home where I came from,
but that isn’t sensible, either. Oh, I don’t know!
I’ll know, I suppose, when the time comes.”</p>

<p>“That’s good sense and good theology—which is
tantamount, though lots of people don’t know it,”
said Mr. Lancaster. “It seems to me that you have
a decidedly real place here, as you put it. Miss
Braithwaite is strong and active, but at sixty-five
the goal is in sight. It seems to me that to stay on
here, companion her, look after her, work in with
her in her numerous ways of usefulness till you can
carry them on alone as she drops out, is an opportunity
anyone might welcome. Miss Braithwaite is
a power for good; there is no one whom I admire
more, and everyone, from the bishop of the diocese
to that small lame boy in whom you are interested,
turns to her for help. To prolong such a life and
make it happier—of course there is no better way
to prolong life than by making it a happy life—it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
seems to me I’d think several times before I decided
that was not a worth while chance for a young thing
like you!”</p>

<p>Cis returned the smile that Mr. Lancaster bent
upon her, but she said:</p>

<p>“That all sounds beautiful, and it is more than
worth while; the only trouble is that I can’t imagine
my doing it! I wonder where Miss Braithwaite is?
Don’t I hear Ellen bringing someone in here?”</p>

<p>Ellen pushed open the heavy doors of the
library.</p>

<p>“Miss Lucas and Mr. Lucas, Miss Braithwaite,”
she announced, and Cis looked up to see Mr. Wilmer
Lucas coming forward, and behind him Jeanette
Lucas.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Lucas!” Cis cried, and ran forward to
greet Miss Lucas on a sort of track of red wool,
trailing her crimson knitting by a needle caught in
the fold of her gown, the little lame lad’s sweater
which she was just finishing.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Lucas, I am so glad to see you! Ellen,
please find Miss Braithwaite; she may be in her
room. How kind of you to bring your niece here,
Mr. Lucas! You know Mr. Lancaster? Miss Lucas,
this is Miss Braithwaite’s friend, Mr. Lancaster.”</p>

<p>“I’m truly glad to see you, Miss Adair,” said Miss
Lucas in that unforgettable sweet voice of hers.
“And to see you so happy here. Uncle Wilmer has
been telling me that he is grateful to father and me
for sending you to him.”</p>

<p>The two girls stood, their hands still clasped,
looking at each other, both remembering where and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
how they had parted, the singular bond that united
them, all that had come to pass since they had met.</p>

<p>Jeanette Lucas looked years older; her face had
lost its sweetness; it was as beautiful as ever—Cis
thought that she had forgotten how lovely it was—but
older lines, which barely escaped being bitter
ones, had been graven on each side of her delicate
lips, and her eyes were introspective, no longer
meeting other eyes with ready sympathy. Her
wound had gone deep, the cruel wound of finding
unworthy someone whom one has utterly trusted,
and of learning to unlove. She had withdrawn into
herself to hide her hurt.</p>

<p>Jeanette Lucas saw the girl who had been merry,
frank and free, grown older, too, but in every way
bettered by it. Never precisely pretty, Cis’s face
had sweetened and softened; its whole effect was of
a face that had been clarified and ennobled. Dressed
in soft dull gold and brown, her wonderful hair
topped the harmony of color like an aureole; in
undefined motions, intonations, Cis had refined, become
one of the world in which Jeanette Lucas had
been born and always lived.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite, hurrying in, interrupted this
unconscious scrutiny of each other which absorbed
the girls in oblivion to all else. She welcomed
Jeanette cordially, even affectionately, putting her
at once into Cicely’s chair close to hers before the
fire.</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster dropped into his usual place;
Mr. Lucas, in a capacious chair in the middle. For
a moment Cis hesitated, then she took a low stool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
and put herself close on the other side of Jeanette.
It seemed to her that Anselm Lancaster found Miss
Lucas interesting, and instantly Cis’s busy brain
began to weave a plot to which the happy ending
was intrinsic.</p>

<p>“Father is perfectly well, thank you, Miss Braithwaite,”
Jeanette was replying to Miss Lucas. “We
went abroad on my account, but he profited from it
more than I—except as it added to my knowledge.
Father already had enough knowledge of pictures
and architecture. We had a delightful trip, yes,
thanks; England, France, Italy; Spain, to a limited
extent. I’d like to go back. Why not go with me,
Miss Adair?”</p>

<p>“I am going; I’m saving up to go,” said Cis unexpectedly;
Jeannette had not been in earnest. “I’m
getting ready for it in other ways; Miss Braithwaite
and Mr. Lancaster talk about Europe so much
that I almost know which corner to turn to buy
shoe-strings, or to see the best pictures in the gallery!
I’ll show you the way around Europe, Miss
Lucas, if you will let me go with you.”</p>

<p>“Miss Adair can show you many other things besides
the way around Europe, Jeanette!” Mr. Lucas
corroborated Cis. “If ever the day dawns that I’m
not involved in crises of several corporations and
public affairs, simultaneously, I’ll take you both
abroad; Miss Braithwaite shall go as duenna and
Mr. Lancaster as cicerone.”</p>

<p>“A contract, before witnesses!” cried Mr. Lancaster.
“I want to show you a picture in Florence
for which you might have sat as model, Miss Lucas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“How delightful! I’ll keep the appointment,
Mr. Lancaster,” said Jeanette. “Miss Braithwaite,
do you know why I’m here to-day?”</p>

<p>“Because you knew how glad I’d be to see my
little Jeanette again?” suggested Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Braithwaite, I hope you are!” said
Jeanette, touching Miss Braithwaite’s hand. “That’s
dear of you, but that’s not why. We are in desperate
straits for a housekeeper. She must not be
an ordinary person, but someone quite extraordinary.
Father is going away, to be gone a year;
possibly more. Mother is in wretchedly bad
health; father will not leave to me the responsibility
for that great house of ours, the children and
the servants; rightly or wrongly, he doesn’t consider
me competent to it. He wants a woman higher
above suspicion than Cæsar’s wife; competent to
take charge; good, and she should not be a common
person, or the servants will not obey her, and
I doubt that the children would; they’re keen-eyed
little animals! I suggested to father that he had
these qualities compounded in a laboratory, and
the form containing them somehow galvanized into
the semblance of a living human being, but he said:
‘Before we resort to such extreme measures to get
the unlikely person we want, you run over to visit
your uncle at Beaconhite, and see Miss Miriam
Braithwaite. She is a such a good Roman that she
has acquired some of St. Peter’s quality of fisher of
men; she has all sorts of ramifications out, and no
end of all kinds of people on her lines. Quite possibly
she may know precisely the person we need,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
and one who equally needs us.’ So here I am, Miss
Braithwaite, at your mercy.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, that’s a hard order to fill! Can you
suggest anyone, Anselm?” began Miss Braithwaite,
when Cis interrupted with an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Miss Gallatin!” she cried. “Nice, queer, splendid
Miss Hannah Gallatin!”</p>

<p>“The very person! But why do you think she’d
go, Cicely?” said Miss Braithwaite. “She takes
boarders, and is going on well, I think?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure she perfectly detests taking boarders,”
insisted Cis. “I believe she’d love to be with people
like the Lucases, with children to help bring up,
and someone she’d love, like Miss Jeanette! I’m
sure she’s horribly lonely; she was dear and good
to me; she would adore Miss Jeanette. Wouldn’t
it be all right to ask her?”</p>

<p>“I am sure that Miss Adair has hit it!” cried Mr.
Lancaster, rising. “I know Miss Gallatin well, and
she is lonely, and she does loathe her present surroundings.
I’m going home; I pass near her house.
Would you like me to sound her for you, Miss
Lucas?”</p>

<p>“I’d be most grateful,” returned Jeanette.
“Though it makes my head whirl to find the impossible
right around the corner, turning possible
under my eyes! I had no idea of getting so much as
a clue to a person!”</p>

<p>“This is the House of the Thaumaturgi; you see
your friend, Miss Adair, is getting their powers;
this suggestion was hers,” said Mr. Lancaster, and
said good night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Now you two children take each other off somewhere,
and compare notes on these past months
since you met,” ordered Miss Braithwaite. “I suspect
you want to see each other, and I know that I
want to talk to Mr. Lucas, now that he has delivered
himself into my hands!”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t realize how little I really know
you,” Cis said apologetically, as she led Jeanette
to her own room.</p>

<p>“Neither do I!” retorted Jeanette. “I think we
agreed that circumstances had made us friends beyond
common measures of time and opportunity.
May I speak like an old friend? May I call you
Cis; will you call me Jeanette? That’s right! You
have changed a great deal, Cis; you are wonderfully
changed. So am I, but not for the better, like you.
My uncle has told me what you have done. My
dear, my dear, I am proud of you, and ashamed of
me! You have been brave, faithful, and you are
not whining! I’ve been bitter, awfully, horribly
bitter, Cis! I hope it’s better now. I’ve been feeling
that it wasn’t fair, what happened to me. I suspect
it hurt my pride. I felt insulted, dragged down,
as if God had dealt unfairly with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no!” cried Cis. “God doesn’t deal unfairly;
why would He? You wouldn’t. But any
girl would feel insulted in your place; it’s a shame!
I thought so then, and I’ve been thinking so ever
since. But it wasn’t God’s fault, you know. Don’t
you suppose God saved you from worse sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do! He sent you, true-hearted and
courageous, to interfere for me!” cried Jeanette.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
“Cis, I’ve blessed you before every shrine I visited
in Europe and here!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s likely that you saved me in your turn,
Jeanette. I might easily have slipped my cable;
likely you helped me hold,” said Cis simply.</p>

<p>“Do you know what <i>you</i> have done, Cicely of the
burnished hair? You have impressed my uncle
Wilmer by your action, coming as it did on top of
my great father’s choice of the Old Church, Miss
Braithwaite, and other people and things. He is
looking into the Church; he never would before!
He told me he was going to satisfy himself just what
this strange power rested upon that made ordinary
people martyrs and saints! He is a prejudiced,
strong-willed man, Cis, but he is an honest one,
and you know what happens when honest people
begin this study. Your hand set this in motion,
Cicely Adair!” cried Jeanette.</p>

<p>Cis looked up, then she looked down, for tears
stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Would you really call it my hand?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, the nails which hold the wall together
do not drive themselves,” said Jeanette. “Cis, do
you remember Mr. Singer, of the telephone office at
home? I saw him lately; he asked about you. He
told me that, although he was forced to dismiss you
from the office for what you did, because it was a
flagrant break of their rules, still he admired you
exceedingly for it, as well as for your qualities as
he knew them. He said that they were making a
department of welfare work for their employees,
and that he knew no one whom he would so well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
like to have over it as you. He said that if I came
in contact with you he should be grateful if I would
tell you this, and ask you to communicate with him.
He said that he wanted a girl of high character, integrity,
kindness, and someone able to entertain
and attract the girls whom she looked after; he
added that you were the one above all others whom
he had in mind. So I’m handing on the message, in
spite of disloyalty to Uncle Wilmer! You can think
it over. At least your dismissal, Cicely, is thus
squared off! Mr. Singer did not betray that he
knew it was I who was involved in your violation of
the rule of the company, but I’m sure that he did.
Do you want to come home again, Cis? It’s good
for you to be here, but I’m selfish enough to wish
you were at home again.”</p>

<p>“That was nice of Mr. Singer; thank you for telling
me, Jeanette. I don’t know what I want to do;
I’m all at loose ends in my mind, but I think, after
I’ve boiled for awhile, I’ll settle down; not boil
over,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“It takes a long time to get one’s bearings after
an earthquake,” agreed Jeanette. “I’ve been
wretched, unhappy, bitter, bewildered; I’m better.
But, Cis, you don’t look like any of these things;
you look good, sweet and good, and—well, <i>clear</i>
is the word! It isn’t going to be a vocation, is it?”</p>

<p>“For a convent? Oh, no; I’m afraid not. I’m
not that sort; I’m active. Do you suppose there ever
was a red-haired contemplative? Even though the
hair was cut off when she was professed? I doubt
it! You were always so good!” cried Cis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“I don’t know, I don’t know! I wish I might go,”
cried Jeanette. “It seems mean to offer yourself
to God because a man failed you.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be that; it would be that a man
showed you that only God was worth loving,” Cis
corrected her with the insight that was new to her.
“If God wanted you, why would you care how He
got you? I can see that there are all sorts of ways.”</p>

<p>“My dear, my dear, you have travelled far in a
short while!” said Jeanette; then sighed and smiled.
“We have come to the end of our talk; there is no
more after that. Come back to Miss Braithwaite
and my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Anselm Lancaster called up, Jeanette and Cis,”
Miss Braithwaite said as the girls came back into
the library. “He says that Miss Gallatin was overjoyed
at the suggestion of getting away from her detested
business and looking after Lucases of assorted
sizes. She is coming to see you, here, in the
morning, Jeanette. You are to stay the night; I’ve
arranged with your uncle, and I only hope that you
may carry off with you that pearl of great price,
Hannah Gallatin.”</p>

<p>Miss Gallatin and Jeanette Lucas saw each other
with perceiving eyes in the morning, and Jeanette
went with Miss Gallatin in Miss Braithwaite’s coupé
to find Mr. Lucas in his office to arrange for the
speediest winding up of Miss Gallatin’s affairs.</p>

<p>“You had an inspiration, Cis,” declared Miss
Braithwaite when Jeanette Lucas had gone home
again from Beaconhite, with all arrangements
made for Miss Gallatin to follow her. “A lonely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
woman, and a home that needs her. Jeanette Lucas
will gain much from Miss Gallatin, and Hannah
Gallatin will be lonely no more.”</p>

<p>“I wonder—” Cis began, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Miss Braithwaite waited.</p>

<p>“If I had another inspiration?” Cis went on.
“May I say it? I wondered if Mr. Lancaster would
not fall in love with Jeanette Lucas, and whether
it would not be beautiful if he did?”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite stared, then she laughed.</p>

<p>“She’s a lovely creature, and I’d not blame anyone
for falling in love with her—you have fallen
a wee bit in love with her yourself! But, Cis, my
dear, are you getting to be a matchmaker? That’s a
sign of old age, poor Cis! Why, I’m not nearly old
enough to try to pair people off—or am I old
enough to know it’s a risky business, besides being
hard to work? That would be a pretty pair, I admit,
and suitable. Well, well; possibly! Then you
think my beloved Anselm is good enough even for
Jeanette Lucas?”</p>

<p>“For anyone; too good for almost anyone else,”
said Cis promptly. “Miss Braithwaite, Jeanette
said that she told you about the telephone welfare
department at home, and Mr. Singer’s selecting me
to run it. What ought I do?”</p>

<p>“Come to dinner,” said Miss Braithwaite instantly,
winding her arm around Cis to take her to
the dining room. “And stay where you are till you
get marching orders which can’t be forged. Dear
me, are young girls the only ones that have a claim?
How about an old girl who needs you? Stay with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
me, Cicely Adair, at least till you can endure me no
longer! You’re a bright spot of comfort, my child,
and I like to see your red hair beside my red fire on
the hearth!”</p>

THE OLD BOTTLE FOR NEW WINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE winter slipped away, melting into spring,
and Cis had not left Beaconhite. Increasingly
interested in her completely transformed life,
growing daily fonder of Miss Braithwaite, Cicely
continued to serve Mr. Lucas happily in his office,
finding the great matters constantly beneath her
fingers more and more intriguing, going at night
back into that peacefully beautiful house, into its
books, its charming talk, its lofty ideals.</p>

<p>“I’m getting nicer and nicer!” Cis mocked herself
one night in her own room, before her mirror.
It was perfectly true; she was “getting nicer” and
was becoming something far more than her adjective
conveyed.</p>

<p>When June came Miss Braithwaite announced to
Cis that she was to take a vacation of three months
and go with her touring the New England coast and
the White Mountains.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether we shall go on up to Montreal
or not; it shall be as we feel when the time
comes. We will stop where we please, for as long as
we please, and we will not measure our trip by
miles but by satisfactions,” Miss Braithwaite said.
Cis caught her breath in delight.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” she exclaimed. “What a suggestion!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
It is rather flooring! But how can I go? I’ll lose
my job! Mr. Lucas can’t hold on to a secretary who
is flying all over New England!”</p>

<p>“Easily,” replied Miss Braithwaite. “If you can
broadcast a song by radio, you can broadcast a secretary
by automobile! I’m not one bit afraid of
your losing your job; besides, I’ve sounded Mr.
Lucas!”</p>

<p>Cis laughed. “Trust you to secure yourself—and
me!” she cried. “Miss Braithwaite, I’ll probably
die of joy on the way; simply blow right up in
the car.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that the car will not blow up with
you and me both in it!” retorted Miss Braithwaite,
well pleased with Cis’s pleasure. “It is quite settled
that we are to spend the summer on wheels. I want
you to see the ocean breaking over the rocks of that
coast, you who have seen the ocean only as it comes
up on New Jersey sands. I want you to hear it cannonade
into those rock-caves, and retreat from
them in foam and spray. You’re too enthusiastic
to miss a note of that vast harmony. Anselm Lancaster
says if we go he will drive after us and join
us somewhere for July and August.”</p>

<p>“How fine!” cried Cis, frankly delighted. “That
will keep us from missing the hearth, if we are inclined
to. Mr. Lancaster will make it homelike,
and how nice it will be for you to have him there
to talk to!”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite was regarding Cis sharply; she
said:</p>

<p>“Nice for you, too, will it not be? In case I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
in a lazy mood, he can drive you to any point that
you should see.”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to bother him,” said Cis. “But of
course it will be great for me to have him with us.
He’s no end good to me, takes me right in, because
you do. Will he go alone?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t speak of anyone else; I don’t know.
He’s extremely fond of that recent convert who was
an Episcopalian minister, Paul Ralph Randolph.
Paul is having a hard time; perhaps Anselm will
ask him to go with him. Then it’s settled, Cicely.
I’ve spoken to Mr. Lucas, but you’d better speak of
it to him in the morning.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite turned away as she spoke, and
met Father Morley just coming in.</p>

<p>After a few words with him, Cis ran away to
write to Nan, and Miss Braithwaite laid before the
Jesuit her summer plan.</p>

<p>When she told him that Anselm Lancaster was
likely to be added to the party, Father Morley lifted
his eyebrows inquiringly, without a word.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” Miss Braithwaite agreed with
him. “I see, but I don’t know, truly. I do know
that the idea never crosses Cicely’s mind, and so,
though I understand how and why the approaches
to her mind are guarded against the entrance of the
idea, still, it does seem to me that there can’t be
ground for our entertaining it. It’s hard for me to
believe in the novel heroine who has no suspicion
that she is sought until the hero plumps himself
down on his knees at her feet! I think, as a rule,
a woman feels even the dawn of interest in her, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
power of her attraction, before any onlooker can
sense it.”</p>

<p>“If she doesn’t subtly suggest to him that he admires
her?” suggested Father Morley, with his quizzical
half-smile.</p>

<p>“You’ve been reading George Bernard Shaw!”
cried Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I’m ashamed of you! Thackeray
said it before he did, but in point of fact one needs
to read neither of them to know that law of natural
history,” said Father Morley. “Well, and if Cicely’s
preoccupation were wrong, and our half-formed
suspicion were right, how about it? Would it do?”</p>

<p>“At first I thought not, when it occurred to me,”
said Miss Braithwaite. “I do not believe that two
people can be happy together if the door to the
deepest tastes and feelings of one will not yield to
the hand of the other. To my mind it is madness
to expect life to be anything but galling when it is
lived in close proximity to a person to whom one
may not speak of the things nearest to the heart
whether for lack of sympathy in tastes or, still
more, in principles. But I have come to think that,
in this case, there would not be that lack; Cicely
has an excellent mind, and rare perception; her big
heart and loyal truth are rare. I am coming to think
that it would do exceedingly well, and to fear that
it may never happen. Would you approve it,
Father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; yes, indeed! I make it a rule to approve
everything of that sort to which there is no
actual objection. I’ve found that is the easiest way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
to an end that is sure to be reached, whatever I
say,” replied Father Morley with his quiet smile,
his eyes laughing at Miss Braithwaite’s chagrin at
his provoking lack of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Well, I assure you it would be a lucky man who
married Cis. She is a splendid girl,” Miss Braithwaite
declared, as Cis came back in time to catch
the last five words.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re talking of Cis Adair?” she cried.</p>

<p>“As it happens, I was,” said Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>“At least I’m a fortunate girl,” said Cis quietly.</p>

<p>Father Morley smiled at her with genuine admiration.</p>

<p>“It is always a lucky person who may truthfully
be called splendid; assuming that it is luck that
carves character, which is at least open to debate.”</p>

<p>“My funny little character lay down and let two
skillful pairs of hands carve it,” said Cis with a
grateful smile for these two people who had such
a large part in her recent molding.</p>

<p>The summer passed in the way Miss Braithwaite
had planned, a summer of such delight to Cis that
each night when she lay down to sleep she wondered
if it were really she, Cicely Adair, who was
passing through scenes of natural beauty, such as
she had never seen, in a luxurious car, with a companion
who enhanced every beauty by her talk,
linking it with other beauty, playing upon it with
her wit and wisdom. When the mood was upon
them they halted in a fine hotel, where Cis came
into contact with a world that she had not known;
where at night she danced in her pretty, thin frocks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
her glorious hair the observed of every eye, moving
to orchestras that played perfect dance music perfectly.</p>

<p>The girl drank deep of youthful joy and blossomed
under it. She moved with a new grace added
to her natural lissom, free carriage, and her face,
alive with the interests filling her quick brain,
transformed by suffering largely outlived, a temptation
conquered, a soul at peace and knowing its
way, was so attractive that no one ever stopped to
consider whether or not she was beautiful.</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster had fulfilled his promise and
had joined Miss Braithwaite on the north shore,
beyond Boston, in July. His roadster sometimes
followed, sometimes preceded Miss Braithwaite’s
large car, driven by her man, and Paul Ralph Randolph,
the convert whom older Catholics were honoring
for his sacrifices for conscience, with the
ready admiration those born in the Church are
quick to accord a convert, was Anselm Lancaster’s
companion on the trip. Sometimes Miss Braithwaite
rode with Anselm, Cis and Mr. Randolph in
the big car; sometimes Cis went with Anselm in the
roadster, while Miss Braithwaite welcomed Mr.
Randolph to a place beside her and to the profound
satisfaction which her wise talk gave the young
man, hard beset on the new-old road, from which
he had no temptation to turn back.</p>

<p>Thus they went through the loveliness of the
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine coasts,
turned off into the White Mountain region, but
omitted for this time the Canadian possibility.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
Thus they made their way leisurely down again,
through the Berkshires, back to Beaconhite, just as
the children were trooping to school, and the hint
of summer’s passing, autumn’s approach, was in
the air.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite was no wiser as to the future
event which she had discussed with Father Morley
than she had been in setting forth. Of Cis she was
entirely sure; she had no thought in her mind of
that which her friend considered for her. Of Anselm
she was less sure, yet he gave her no actual
ground for supposing that he perceived Cis in any
different light from that in which Miss Braithwaite
saw her as a dear, lovely, lovable and noble girl.
Miss Braithwaite knew quite well that it is a totally
other matter to want to marry a girl, than to see in
her all sorts of desirable traits.</p>

<p>They had not been back in Beaconhite quite two
weeks when two things happened to change the direction
of Miss Braithwaite’s plans, and Cicely’s,
no less.</p>

<p>An old friend of Miss Braithwaite’s, living in
California, was desperately ill and begged her
friend to come to her. Miss Braithwaite was going;
she could not, nor would not refuse.</p>

<p>Then Cis had a letter from Nan imploring her
to come back to her old home in October. There
would be a little boy, or a little girl, there then
whose godmother Cis, and no one else, must be.
Nan implored Cis to come to see her before her
baby was born, and to stay on to sponsor it at the
font. Miss Braithwaite had intended leaving Cis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
her house and servants to look after while she was
gone, but this news from Nan focused Cicely’s
vague intention to return to her old home, and she
decided to go back when Miss Braithwaite went
away.</p>

<p>“You will come back to me, Miss Adair?” Mr.
Lucas had said when she told him that for a while,
at least, she would not return to her desk.</p>

<p>“I hope so, Mr. Lucas; I suppose so,” Cis said.
“Miss Braithwaite wants me to come back when she
gets home. If her friend dies, as seems likely, she
will be saddened, and may need me a little bit when
she comes home. I’m pretty sure to come back.”</p>

<p>“Whoever may be in your place, I will gladly exchange
for you when you come,” said Mr. Lucas.
“Promise me not to tell Jeanette a secret when you
see her! I am not ready for them to know it, but
you have a right to be told before you go. Your
extraordinary choice of your Church when everything
called you from her, impressed me to such an
extent that I made up my mind to find out what was
in her thus to raise people above themselves. I
have been investigating it. I want to tell you,
Cicely Adair, that I have found out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Lucas!” cried Cis jumping up with a
radiant face. “I’m so glad, so glad! And I must
tell you that you’ve no idea how much you’ll like
the Church when you can stop investigating her,
when you begin just to live with her! I’d no sort
of idea how splendid she was! I’m so glad I have
her, that now I think I didn’t sacrifice a thing then—though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
it did hurt at the time, and I came horribly
near slipping off.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas laughed. “That’s not a bad tribute to
your Mother, my dear,” he said, “though it’s a bit
funny. I’m quite sure that I shall find her precisely
what you say ‘when I begin to live with her’!”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite went to California. Anselm
Lancaster took Cis to the train to see Miss Braithwaite
off, and then, an hour later, put Cis on her
train to return to her home.</p>

<p>“‘Always the best of friends,’ Miss Cis, like Joe
Gargery and little Pip, aren’t we?” he asked, holding
Cis’s hand for a dallying moment of farewell.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, if you’ll keep up your half of it,
though I don’t know Joe Gargery, nor little Pip,”
Cis said.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter; they were the best of
friends; that’s the salient point,” Anselm said.
“And I don’t want you to forget that so are we.
You’ll come back this winter, when Miss Braithwaite
comes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I think so, if she wants me. I’ll
miss her—and you—and the dear library; the
whole wonderful house and my life in it, and all the
kindness I’ve had, and the untellable things I’ve
learned. Oh, I shall miss it all!” Cis choked.</p>

<p>“Only for a visit; you’re going only for a visit!
Beaconhite holds you on the other end of a tether!
Good-bye, Miss Cicely. I’m afraid the sunshine
goes out with your hair.” Anselm pressed Cicely’s
hand hard, put into her lap a book and a box of
candy, together with a long box with a protruding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
ribbon over one side, all of which Cis had pretended
not to see, though she knew quite well what
their purpose was, and she felt a girlish satisfaction
in being thus freighted and sped.</p>

<p>The train rolled out of the station, and Cis was
on her way home.</p>

<p>It was a long, tiresome journey, but it gave Cis
time to consider her history since she had made the
same journey in the reverse direction. A lifetime
lay between the journeys, it seemed to her. Basically
she was the same Cicely Adair who had come
to Beaconhite to try her fortune; in her on that
day had lain the potential qualities and attitudes of
mind which these months had brought out, but so
tremendous had been all that had happened to her,
so far-reaching in its effect—reaching as far as all
eternity—that it was by no means the same Cis
who was going back to Nan.</p>

<p>At the station, when Cis arrived in the growing
dusk, a young man came forward to greet her. He
was attired in such perfection that his effort to appear
at his best positively screamed aloud to all
passers-by. Cis did not know him, and, though he
was bearing down on her, it was with a hesitation,
in spite of his advance toward her, that spoke a like
uncertainty in him. Only when he came quite up
to her did Cis cry:</p>

<p>“Well, Tom! Tom Dowling! To think of my not
knowing you! Nice of you to come!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure of you, Cis,” said Tom uneasily.
“You’re—you’re awfully different!”</p>

<p>“That’s true, I am,” said Cis. “But you’ve grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
up since I saw you. You’re not bigger; I don’t
mean that, but you’re grown up!”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” declared Tom with a slight
swagger. “But I’m hardly any younger than you;
don’t try to talk like a grandmother! Girls get old
quicker. You’ve what is it? Side?”</p>

<p>“Goodness, is it?” laughed Cis. “Aren’t we going
somewhere, Tom? We aren’t going to stay here all
night, are we? It was good of Nan to send you to
meet me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i>! Of <i>Nan</i>! To <i>send</i> me!” Tom cried in
a series of small explosions. “Gosh! As though a
man had no mind of his own! As though Nan sent
me, like a kid! I tell you, Cis, I’ve hardly been able
to sleep since I heard you were coming, for fear I’d
miss meeting your train! I tell you, Cis, it’s been
hard sledding with you gone, and if I’ve grown old
it’s from missing you, if you want to know!”</p>

<p>“Well, Tom! That’s a dear boy to remember Cis
so hard,” said Cis, falling back into her old boyish
way of speaking, association with the place and
with the lad to whom she had returned, calling it
out. But she found this earnestness of Tom’s
wearisome, and devoutly wished that he had not
been so loyal to her memory.</p>

<p>“Come over to the taxi stand,” said Tom.
“Here, give over that suitcase. Checks?”</p>

<p>“One check, one small trunk,” said Cis yielding
up her case and check to this protector.</p>

<p>Tom handed her check to an expressman, and
gave him the address of Nan’s house. Then he resumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
his way toward the taxi stand, holding Cis
by one elbow.</p>

<p>As he put her into the cab, and entered it himself
he said:</p>

<p>“Say, Nan has a son; three days old, he is. She
wouldn’t let them telegraph you for fear you’d hold
off coming a little. But she told me to tell you that
she was so crazy to see you that it would do her
more good to have you walk in than even to see the
baby! And heaven knows, she’s wild over him,
though, honest; he’s not such a much! I never saw
one so young, and I think age improves ’em more’n
it does wine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, of course she’s wild over her baby
son!” cried Cis. “I’m going to be wild over him
myself! He’s to be one third mine; Nan said so.
He’s my godson, or will be, as soon as we can get
him made so. What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Matt, Matthew, for Joe’s father; I’m not keen
for it,” said Tom. “Joe wanted it, and Nan always
likes to please him, so it’s Matt. Nan wanted
him called Cyril.”</p>

<p>“I like Matt better; Cyril is too dressy for Nan’s
boy; she’s such a simple, dear little mouse!” said
Cis decidedly. “Oh, Tom, here we are!”</p>

<p>“Well, Cis, dear, didn’t you think if the taxi went
on running we’d get here?” asked Tom, intending
to be humorous, and helping Cis out.</p>

<p>Nan held out her arms when Cis came up the
stairs, running to her headlong.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cis; oh, Cis! I’m so glad!” Nan cried, and
Cis kissed her with tears, repeatedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>Nan a wife and now a mother! Not only for Cis
had these months been full of changes. Nan had a
son to praise God for, but Cis—what had she?
Less? No; more! A son was another soul to rejoice
over, but Cis felt that the creation of her soul
was a wonder greater than ordinary birth.</p>

<p>Nan looked at her with appraising eyes, as Cis
arose from her knees beside her, covered over the
face of tiny Matt, held in the hollow of his mother’s
arm, and fell back a step or two, looking down on
Nan.</p>

<p>“Cis, you have changed! But it is all for the better!”
cried Nan. “You don’t look one bit unhappy;
your eyes are lovely, dear! and you are—what
is it? Like a very fine, fine lady, Cis! You’ve
written me of your lovely friend, that wonderful
Miss Braithwaite, and her house, and her friends,
but—what has happened to you?”</p>

<p>“Everything, Nan! I am happy, but I’m still
more thankful. It has been a miracle-time for me,
more so, even, than for you. I’ll tell you when I
may; you must not be tired. I’m quite all right,
Nannie; be sure of that,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“You look it,” said Nan slowly. “It will not tire
me to hear it all to-night. Mother is here. Go
down and find her, and have your tea. Joe will be
home in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Cis went down. Mrs. Dowling greeted her with
her old manner of uncertainty as to what Cis
might be about to do next, but it rapidly gave
way to wonder, and then to constraint. Cis did
not intend to produce any such effect, nor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
she conscious that she did so, but about her
was the fine atmosphere of Miss Braithwaite’s
house, and her recent associations with minds
and souls informed with knowledge, divine and
human. Mrs. Dowling began half to fear Cis,
and then to entertain a hope that Tom, whose infatuation
for Cis had always distressed her, might
find favor in the eyes of this charming girl, whose
pretty clothes were worn with an air, whose pretty
manners were wholly unconscious.</p>

<p>That evening Cis was allowed to spend an hour
with Nan; she drew a low chair beside her, laid her
godson, a roll of soft white wool, across her knees,
and made ready to talk.</p>

<p>“Cis, dear, am I to know what happened?” asked
Nan timidly. “I saw Mr. Moore when he was here,
looking for you. I could not understand, but evidently
he could not, either. What was wrong? Or
do you mind telling me?”</p>

<p>“No. I expected to tell you, Nannie. I did mind
writing about it. It is all right now; I am thankful
to say that I’m happy, as I told you I was, and
I can talk about it.”</p>

<p>Then Cis told, simply, but completely, the story
of her engagement and its breaking, giving more
expression to her own fight against temptation than
she had ever done to Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>Nan listened with wide eyes, breathless, not interrupting.
When Cis ended, with a long breath
of relief that the story was told, Nan put out her
hand and softly touched Cis, her eyes full of tears,
but fuller of adoring love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>“To think that I used to be afraid you were not a
good Catholic!” she said. “To think that I imagined
that I was a better one than you were, I, who never
in all my life suffered one little pang for my faith!
Why, Cis; why, Cis, dearest! I’m so glad I know
you! And I’m so glad that little Matthew will have
you for a godmother! I am almost sure that he
will be a priest, and may be a saint!”</p>

<p>“You little ninny-Nanny!” cried Cis, jumping
up, almost forgetting the baby, but saving him from
a fall by a clutch on the outer layer of his many
envelopes. “You must be getting tired; a little
light-headed! I’m going off. If ever you say anything
so silly to me as that again I’ll cut your acquaintance,
and ungodmother your son! So there!”</p>

<p>She kissed Nan good night, gave her little son to
her, and ran off to her own room.</p>

<p>“They’re nice, good people, and Nan is a darling,
always was, but—Beaconhite seems like home, not
here, and no one here seems to me like anyone I
ever knew well,” thought Cis; she looked sadly at
herself in the mirror as she braided her glowing
hair.</p>

<p>There is no exile so remote, no loneliness so
profound as the return to old associations which
have been completely outgrown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

THE WEAVING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CIS stayed on, living on the surface of her little
native city. Miss Braithwaite was still in California;
she wrote that she could not tell how long
she might be detained; it seemed probable that it
would be for all of the winter, or its greater part.
Her friend was dying slowly in the lingering agonies
of the most agonizing of all diseases; she clung to
Miss Braithwaite, praying her not to leave her, and
Miss Braithwaite had promised to stay to help her
to die. Cis suspected it was also to teach her how
to die; that she was less versed than Miss Braithwaite
in the science of the saints.</p>

<p>With Miss Braithwaite gone, Cis had no desire to
return to Beaconhite; it was not the place, it was
that home and its mistress for which Cis longed, for
the lack of which she felt lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Singer had found out that Cicely Adair had
returned, and he hunted her up, imploring her to
take up his work with his telephone girls, help to
organize the measures which he was trying to put
on foot for their welfare. Cis agreed to undertake
this work, but only with the understanding that she
was free to lay it down at any time. Her experience
under Miss Braithwaite, in Father Morley’s Girls’
Club, in the many good works which occupied her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
Beaconhite friends, stood Cis in good stead now;
she did well with Mr. Singer’s girls, and was interested
in them. It was strange and amusing to
have gone away, dismissed by the Telephone Company
for a breach of law, and return to be placed
over their employees’ pretty rooms for recreation
and rest, installed as the hostess, friend and guide
of these girls.</p>

<p>Cis visited Jeanette Lucas often; the two girls
were strongly drawn to each other; their friendship
deepened and grew. Jeanette had come out of her
trial with a darkened outlook upon life. Cis had
come out of her struggle and loss undismayed,
strengthened, in a sense refreshed, reaping the reward
of her choice. Although there were moments
when a simple tune whistled by a boy in the street,
a phrase, a half resemblance stabbed her with pain,
yet Cis was able truthfully to tell Nan that she was
happy. By temperament and will she was framed
to look forward, not back. Her optimistic courage
was inspiring to Jeanette; she grew fond of Cis
and turned to her as to a tonic, a summons to do her
best also.</p>

<p>Nan was submerged in her house, in its master
and little Matt. She paid Cis her old loving worship,
raised to an incalculable degree by her reverence
for Cis as for one who had given her proofs,
but there was no time in any day to spare for anyone
but Joe and Matt. Nan and Cis met in the baby
more intimately, more frequently than in each
other, outside this powerful little downy link.</p>

<p>To her amazement, Cis discovered herself a baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
worshiper; she had not known that she was a member
of that order, in one of its highest degrees.</p>

<p>Her godson was to her hardly less adorable than
to his mother. She hung over him, absorbing his
violet-scented, milky sweetness as the odor of a
flower; brooding over the miracle of his tiny
features, their curious twistings, the crooked smile
of his sucked-in lips; the funny thrusts of his absurdities
of hands, doubled into fists and taking her
in the eye, or letting her mumble them with kisses
that inclosed the wrinkles of his wrists, the blue-blue
veins traced below the whiteness of the backs
of those belligerent little hands. When he looked
into her eyes and laughed aloud, clutching her
wealth of hair, Cis was elated, humbled, flattered.
In baby Matt she found a new joy that revealed her
to herself; she knew now what she had renounced
when she had gone out of that pretty apartment,
leaving Rodney there amid the ruins of his hopes
and hers. Not for an instant did she regret, turn
back in thought upon her right course, but she understood
the void which ached in her, and often the
baby’s fine white tiny yoke was damp when his godmother
raised her face from it, while he was gurgling
with laughter because she had burrowed into
his neck, tickling him.</p>

<p>Cis boarded with Nan. “Of course you couldn’t
so much as think of living anywhere else, as long as
I have room for you and want you so dreadfully!
Besides, there’s baby!” Nan had said, and there
was nothing to bring against her brief, convincing
arguments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>“It isn’t as though I were going to be here permanently,”
Cis said. “I think no one ought permanently
to live with a married friend, but just till
I go back to Beaconhite—or whatever I do next—I
suppose it won’t be too hard on you, Mrs. Nan!”</p>

<p>Tom Dowling was a model of fraternal devotion
after Cis was installed under Nan’s roof; he made
opportunities to visit his sister to an incredible degree.</p>

<p>“Good old Tommy is a dear boy, but I wonder if
he really thinks I don’t see through him!” Nan
cried.</p>

<p>“Paraffine paper is thick beside his transparency;
you’d be more than blind to miss seeing through
him,” Joe answered.</p>

<p>Tom brought extraordinary things to the baby,
toys which would require two more years of life
for him to handle—a whipping top is not adapted
to a boy two months old, nor is a tin locomotive run
by sand that flows upon its wheels from a revolving
sieve, hidden in its smokestack.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tommy, why, <i>why</i>!” Nan sighed one day
when Tom produced a large cow, with a realistic
moo when its head was moved, from a large package
beneath his arm.</p>

<p>“He’ll grow to it; something to cut his ambition
on, same’s you give him that bone thing to chew on
for his teeth,” explained Tom, unabashed.</p>

<p>“Tom’s really a dear, Cis,” Nan said that night
after Tom had gone home. “Mother is perfectly
delighted that he has stuck to you so; she used to
hope he’d see Louise Müller, a neighbor’s daughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
but he never did. Now mother is worrying for fear
you won’t care about him. Do you think that you
ever could, Cis darling? Of course all these cows,
and tops and engines are not for baby; they’re for
you, same as the candy is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to enjoy the cow any more than
Matt does; must I play with it, Nan? Tom didn’t
offer it to me,” Cis sighed.</p>

<p>“Not directly. I mean they’re all intended to
make you notice him. I’d almost die of joy, Cis, if
you were my sister!” cried Nan.</p>

<p>“Adopt me, Nannie. We can make it as effectual,
and I’m afraid it’s the only way,” Cis suggested.
“Don’t look cast-down; Tom will be all right, and
it’s better to have him imagine he cares about me
than to be growing up without an object. He’ll find
the right girl later, and in the mean time it keeps
him safe for her.”</p>

<p>“Growing up! He’s as old as you are, or so
nearly it comes to the same thing!” cried Nan.
“You don’t take Tom seriously, but he takes himself—and
you—seriously enough.”</p>

<p>“Boys do,” said Cis. “Don’t fuss, little grandmother;
it’s enough to be a mother and bring up
Matt. He’s learning to love me, too, by the way!”</p>

<p>As the days passed, however, Cis began to take
Tom more seriously; he began to be a burden on
her mind. He dogged her footsteps; wherever she
went Tom turned up. He watched for chances to
do her small services, carried out her least suggestions,
modelled himself upon the advice which she
had given him when she had first come back, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
she realized that she must not let him conform
himself to her ideas, before she began to look upon
him as anything more than Tommy Dowling, Nan’s
honest and likable boy-brother.</p>

<p>“If only Miss Braithwaite would come back!”
thought Cis. “I’d go away and he’d do something
sensible with himself! All I can do now is to hold
him down, and hold him off, but I’m really beginning
to be afraid it’s bad for him.”</p>

<p>One bright, frosty afternoon, when the earth was
white and the sky brilliantly blue, Cis went off
alone to walk in the park. A homesick spell was
upon her; she was homesick for Miss Braithwaite,
for the shadowy library and its glowing hearth; for
Mr. Lucas’ office and its interests, the clever, keen
men who came there talking of great matters; her
sense of being part of a world moved by levers hidden
in that office. And she wondered why it was
that for some time she had heard no word of Anselm
Lancaster. He had written her several pleasant
letters, had sent her a book at Christmas that
was a delight to brain and eye. He had wished her
a Happy New Year with a graceful note and a
lovely little Florentine print in colors, framed in
dull, dark, carved wood; a Botticelli Madonna surrounded
by square-chinned, deep-eyed angels in
tunics, upon which their square-trimmed locks fell
at shoulder length, while their long fingers clasped
tall candles that revealed to the world a Babe upon
His Mother’s knee.</p>

<p>There was growing in Cicely a discontent that she
could not down; she grappled with it, hating it, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
no mood had ever mastered her, nor greatly annoyed
her heretofore, and this restlessness was annoying;
it got between her and her daily life; her
prayers; between her and herself, her true self,
brave and blithe and courageous. She wanted to
walk briskly in the pretty park and think out what
was wrong with her, take herself to task, and scotch
the head of this miserable little asp gnawing at her.
But hardly had she gone half the width of the park,
its longest way, than there was Tom Dowling, coming
rapidly toward her, his face illumined, his right
arm saluting her.</p>

<p>“Oh, me!” sighed Cis inwardly. “Who wants a
human being omnipresent? Hello, Tom!” she
said aloud. “How do you happen to be here at a
time when all honest folk are at work?”</p>

<p>“Nothing dishonest about me, Cis,” said Tom,
joining her and turning to walk beside her as a matter
of course. “Why, I got the afternoon, and I
went to the house. Nan said you’d gone to the park.
I went around the other way; thought you’d take
the north gate. Anyhow, I’ve found you!”</p>

<p>The satisfaction in Tom’s voice was complete.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom, but—” Cis hesitated.</p>

<p>“You’d rather be by yourself?” cried poor Tom.
“Oh, Cis, you’ve played fair with me! You’re nice
to me, but you’re nothing more. I won’t be able to
blame you, but if you won’t love me, what under
the heavens shall I do? Say, Cis, love me, can’t
you? I’m not such a much, but I ain’t so bad,
honest! I don’t care how far you hunt, you won’t
find anything I’ve done to be ashamed of. I ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
fit for you lots of ways; you’ve got kind of fine
ladified, though I don’t mean you put on. You’re
it, that’s all! But I’m not a bad chap, that’s straight,
and if I was I’d tell you; I wouldn’t fool you for a
kingdom. I’m getting on; I make thirty now, and
two people could live on fifteen hundred, easy—and
the sixty dollars would buy us each some
clothes, and theatre tickets, or something! And
I’ll have more soon. My boss makes a point of
boosting married men—oh, gosh! A married man!
Married to <i>you</i>, Cis! Say, Cis, don’t you think you
could see it, if you looked hard enough? Love me,
I mean?”</p>

<p>“Tom, dear,” said Cis a little wistfully, for the
honest boy’s voice shook, and his eyes were as imploring
as a dog’s eyes. “I like you heaps, better
than before I went away. I didn’t know you so
well then, and besides you’ve come out a great deal.
But I couldn’t love you, Tommy; not that way.
I’m sorry, dear. You are a fine boy, and the girl
who does marry you will be lucky. It never will
be me, and it wouldn’t be right to let you think it
ever might be. Sorry, Tom! I wish you didn’t
think you wanted me. You’d be better off with
someone else, and you’ll find her—”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” cried Tom hoarsely. “Cut out that
line of talk, Cicely Adair! You’re the greatest girl
in the world. There’s no one can hold a candle to
you, so cut it out! If you won’t, you won’t, but
cut out all that talk. I want you, and I’ll keep on
wanting you. If you don’t want me, and don’t want
me so much that you know you’ll never want me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
that settles it, but I want you. Oh, Cis, why can’t
you want me? What is wrong with me? How can
you be so infernally sure you’ll never think of it?
Am I such a mess? Would you tell me why, Cis?”</p>

<p>Cis looked pityingly at Tom’s flushed, stormy
face, listened with tender, pitying amusement to his
incoherent implorations. She tried to explain.</p>

<p>“It’s not that there’s one thing wrong with you,
Tom,” she said. “It’s I. I’m not thinking of marrying.
I’ve grown years older than you are, Tom,
and I’ve grown ever so far off from the old Cis
whom you first knew and liked. I suppose you
knew I was going to be married? I’m glad, thankfully
glad that all that is over; I wouldn’t be happy
now in the way I thought I’d be happy then, not
with the same people, interests. But I shall never
again feel as I felt then, so glad to see someone coming,
so—I’m afraid it is much the way you feel to
me now, Tom dear! Truly you will get over it.
It leaves you changed, older, not so light-hearted,
but it leaves you; it has left me. I shall never so
much as think of marrying you, my nice Nan’s nice
brother; yet I am fond of you, and think you’re
fine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get over it,” groaned Tom.
“If I can’t marry you I can keep on loving you and
that way you do sort of get a person.”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to try to get over it, Tom, because
we’ve got to play up, not go moping along,”
said Cis. “Let’s forget you love me; in that way,
at least, and let’s be glad you love me, or will love
me, more as you do Nan, just as I love you. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
makes the world a fine place to live in when we
know splendid people who are fond of us. Beaconhite,
living in Miss Braithwaite’s house, rather
spoiled me for other places, Tom. You’ve no idea
what a library that is, and what wonderful things
I heard talked of before the fire!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so I’ve heard you say,” growled Tom. “The
old lady herself was a wonder, but how about that
man, that Lancaster who was such a highbrow?”</p>

<p>There was no missing the implication in Tom’s
wrathful voice. Cis felt her blood rush to her hair
in a burning blush that rivalled the hair in brilliance,
and which angered her, knowing the conclusion
which Tom would draw from it. Characteristically,
she grappled with the situation.</p>

<p>“If you mean to hint, Tom Dowling, that Mr.
Lancaster was interested in me, any more than in a
girl living under his old friend’s roof, or I in him,
more than in the most splendid man I ever saw—except
Father Morley, but priests don’t count—you’re
’way, ’way off the mark! I never once
thought of such a thing as his really liking me, and
you’ve got to take my word for it!”</p>

<p>“All right, Cis. I’d take your word for anything,
and I’m fearfully glad to take it on this,” said Tom.
“I’ve been jealous of that chap, but that settles it,
and him. If you won’t hold out a chance to me it’s
some comfort not to think someone else has a
chance. I guess you’re right that Beaconhite has
ruined you. If only you’d never gone! You ran
into the whole thing there.”</p>

<p>Cis knew that Tom meant that there she had met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
and loved Rodney, and there had been separated
from her earlier friends by the higher things to
which she had grown up. It came over her with
sudden force that in Beaconhite she had indeed
found her fate.</p>

<p>She looked across the park with eyes that saw
Beaconhite, the dignified street on which Miss
Braithwaite lived in its most dignified house; the
street where St. Francis Xavier’s church stood; the
garden of its adjoining school; Father Morley’s thin
figure with its drooping shoulders; the altar within
the church, its lamp, her soul’s home. Beaconhite
was her true home. Some day, she thought,
please God, she would go back.</p>

<p>And then her eyes became cognizant of her present
surroundings. She saw at a little distance from
her, a tawdry, shabby woman sitting upon a park
bench, although it was cold, and her silken clothes
were thin. There was no mistaking her, even afar,
for anything but one of those derelicts which sin,
having floated them prosperously for a time, throws
up against the barriers of civilized society to be
dashed to pieces, or caught up by a pitying lifeguard,
as the case may be.</p>

<p>As Cicely noted her, bringing her thoughts back
to what was before her, the woman covertly drew
something out from the sleeve of her coat, and
picked at it.</p>

<p>A bottle! And she was pulling the cork!</p>

<p>Cis sprang forward and ran, not delaying for a
word to Tom, flying toward the wretched being on
the bench. As she reached her the woman, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
had seen her fleeting toward her, raised the bottle
to her lips.</p>

<p>Cis sprang; leaped the last lap of her race against
suicide; threw herself, as a ball player throws himself
against the base, and struck the woman’s elbow.
The bottle fell in myriad pieces on the walk, scenting
the air with the odor of peach stones. The
woman crumbled up and slid to the ground. For
one instant she and her rescuer were beside each
other upon the walk. Then Cis regained her feet
and stood looking down upon the degraded figure
before her, horror, loathing, yet divine pity in her
flushed face. This was the tableau which Tom,
hastening after Cis, saw as he came up.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Cis?” he questioned her
without formulating his question.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Tom, for heaven’s sake!” cried Cis. “I
just made it. If the police come up and catch us,
she’ll be taken in for attempted suicide. We must
get her somewhere, quick.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if she is taken in?” Tom disgustedly
asked, hating to see Cis in proximity to this woman.
“She’ll be looked after by the matron.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! She must be saved, if she can be. Arrest
won’t save her. Can you hear me? Answer me.
Were you a Catholic?” Cis asked, bending over the
collapsed figure.</p>

<p>“Once I was,” the woman muttered.</p>

<p>Cis straightened herself triumphantly. “The
Good Shepherd!” she cried. “Tom, help me to get
her up. You poor thing, get up! We are going to
take care of you. Get up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>Tom reluctantly, yet admiring Cis, lifted the
castaway, and, staggering, she made out to stand.</p>

<p>“Let me alone; I’m sick,” she moaned.</p>

<p>“Yes, we know. Try to come with us. I’m afraid
a policeman will come along,” Cis urged her.</p>

<p>The word acted as a stimulant. “They’d run me
in, vagrant, suicide,” she muttered. “What did
you stop me for? I’ll get it yet.”</p>

<p>Slowly, Tom supporting the woman with his
hands under her arms, disgust and anger on his
face, while Cis walked behind, occasionally steadying
the wavering figure by a hand upon her spine,
they reached the confines of the small park. Cis
hailed a cab; they bundled the woman into it, and
Cis gave the driver his order.</p>

<p>“To the House of the Good Shepherd,” she said.</p>

<p>Then she added herself to the strange party, and
the cab started.</p>

<p>“The Sisters won’t thank us, perhaps,” muttered
Tom.</p>

<p>“Surely they will! There’s no bound to their
charity, and no bound to hope, except death,” cried
Cis. “She is desperately ill.”</p>

<p>“Dissipation, dope, exposure, why wouldn’t she
be ill?” growled Tom. “It’s a great combination
for you to hitch up to, Cis.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. My guardian angel hitches up
to me, and there’s more difference between me and
an angel, than between this woman and me. Are
you comfortable? Do you hear me speaking to
you?” Cis asked.</p>

<p>“I hear. I heard. I don’t want to go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
Sisters; I want to die, die, die! I’ve had enough,”
the woman aroused herself to say.</p>

<p>“Poor soul, I’m sorry!” Cis’s voice was as sweet
as Nan’s when she comforted her baby. “I think
you’ll be glad that we found you. Why, you’re
quite young, and you were pretty!”</p>

<p>“Pretty! Yes, that’s so. I’m twenty-eight or
nine; I don’t know—” the quavering voice trailed
into silence.</p>

<p>“Do you remember your name? Will you tell it
to me, so I can call you by it?” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Lots of names, lots of names; plenty names.
Here I’m Pearl Molineaux. Out in ’Frisco I was
Carmin Casanova. Giddy Gay—that was somewhere
else; I forget. Home in Chicago I was Myrtle
Moore; that’s while I was married,” the woman
said, speaking slowly.</p>

<p>“Chicago!” “Myrtle Moore?” Cicely’s heart
gave a great leap, then stood still. Could it be?
She was sure that it was! She was sure that it had
been given her to save from suicide Rodney’s wife.</p>

<p>She bent down over the woman who had sagged
low in the seat of the taxicab.</p>

<p>“You are the wife of George Rodney Moore?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No. Divorced. Rod and I were divorced,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, God help me!” Cis murmured, and Tom
was frightened by the pallor of her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, I’ll try! Please, help me! Help her;
help me to help her!”</p>

<p>The cab stopped at the door of that beneficent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
house wherein stainless women welcome within
their consecrated walls the outcasts whose stains of
soul their pure hands labor to remove; wherein the
virgin servants of the Good Shepherd carry back to
Him His lost black sheep.</p>

<p>Myrtle Moore was reluctant to enter that portal,
but her strength was spent, her will too enfeebled
by illness to resist anyone who decided for her and
forcibly executed their decisions.</p>

<p>Tom helped Myrtle up the steps; the Sister
Portress responded to their summons on the bell,
and they were shown into a small parlor, from
which Cis was conducted to another reception
room, where a tall nun, in the beautiful white habit
of her order, came to hear from her the story of
this latest rescue and petitioner for her charity.</p>

<p>There was no question of Myrtle’s rejection. Another
nun came to take her away to the infirmary,
and Cis left the convent with the promise to come
regularly to inquire after Myrtle, whose condition
the infirmarian at once pronounced grave. Tom
took Cis’s hand and slipped it into his arm; she
was trembling.</p>

<p>“Great old adventure, splendid Cis?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, don’t talk about it; I can’t!” Cis almost
sobbed. “You don’t know how wonderful it
is!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

ENTANGLED THREADS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Tom put the key of Nan’s front door
into the keyhole and swung the door open
for Cis to precede him into the house, she darted
forward and began swiftly to mount the stairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Cis, hold on!” Tom remonstrated.
“What am I to tell Nan?”</p>

<p>“Anything you like, but beg her to give me a
little time to myself to straighten out my thoughts.
I’m—I suppose I’m tired, Tom,” Cis paused to say,
then continued upstairs, not answering as Nan
called from the dining room:</p>

<p>“Cis, oh, Cis! Come in here a minute! I’ve just
finished the baby’s new coat and pressed it. Come,
see it!”</p>

<p>Tom joined Nan, flushed and happy over the
ironing board, with baby Matt kicking and cooing
in the clothes basket, liking the flavor of its edge,
over which he had fallen and was chewing it.</p>

<p>“Say, Nan, what do you think?” asked Tom mysteriously.
“Talk about melodramas and adventure
stories! Life can give the best author cards and
spades and beat him out on plots! Rodney Moore’s
wife was sitting on a park bench, committing suicide,
all by herself, when along came Cis and your
brother. Cis saw the bottle, ran like a Marathon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
victor, jumped at her, knocked the bottle to smithereens,
and then we took the lady to the Good Shepherd!
She’s a wreck in every way a woman can
wreck herself. How’s that? Rodney Moore’s ex-wife!”</p>

<p>Nan had dropped into a chair, her iron in her
lap, and was staring at Tom with a horrified face.</p>

<p>“Tom, it can’t be!” she gasped. “That woman
doesn’t live here.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know as to that, but she was certainly going
to die here,” insisted Tom.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it means? If she had
taken the stuff that chap would have been free; not
divorced, <i>free</i>. And Cis could have married him,
if she pleased. Yet it was Cis hit the woman’s arm
and saved her! What about it? What does it
mean?”</p>

<p>“It must mean that the poor wretch is going to
have a chance to repent and die decently some day,”
said pious little Nan. “But Rodney Moore’s wife!
And Cis saved her! What a story! Why, Tom, it
makes me shake! Oh, I must go to Cis! I’ll take
the baby up to her. He’ll comfort her.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Cis told me to ask you to let her alone
awhile, till she pulls herself together,” Tom said.
“Nan, the woman looked about all in. If she dies
will Cis—?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I can’t tell,” cried Nan. “I hope
not. Yet I see it would do everything for that man.
It may be the way he’ll come right. We never can
see ahead of the day. But, Tommy dear, don’t
mind too much. I’m quite sure, whether it is Rodney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
Moore again or not, that it will never be you.
I’m sorry, buddy, but that is true.”</p>

<p>“No need of your saying so,” growled Tom. “Cis
said it herself, so plain that it doesn’t need footnotes
for me to get it. All the same—” Tom
stopped, turning away.</p>

<p>“Yes, I say so, too! All the same I’d hate it to
be Rodney Moore. But maybe it is Cis’s work to
save his soul,” said Nan, picking up her son, finding
him an effectual restorative.</p>

<p>“Oh, his soul!” exclaimed Tom, and his tone
sounded like an anathema. “I call it going pretty
far to make a nice girl marry a man to save his
soul!”</p>

<p>“We ought to be willing to die to save a soul,”
Nan reminded him.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly willing that lots of people should
die to save a soul, but I ain’t willing one girl should
marry to save one, not when the girl is Cis,” said
Tom stalking off in disgust the stronger that he had
been badly shaken in nerves.</p>

<p>Up in her room Cis knelt before the window,
staring out into the top of a spruce tree outside
Nan’s little house. It was a long time before she
could think coherently. The horror of the suicide
so nearly accomplished; the almost equal horror of
the woman’s degradation; the unmistakable stamp
upon her of vice, upon her who was Rodney’s wife,
yet who was not in any true sense his wife, nor
could be the wife of any honest man, filled Cicely
with shuddering confusion. It was as if she had a
vision of what it meant when one said: “A lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
soul.” Pity for Rodney overwhelmed her, yet, unjustly
or justly, Cis felt as though he were stained by
the vileness of this bone of his bone, flesh of his
flesh. “And they two shall be as one flesh.” The
words echoed within her mind, empty of connected
thoughts, tense with fragments of thoughts which at
once confused and tortured her poignantly.</p>

<p>After a time Cis began to realize fully what had
befallen her. She had parted from Rod because
this woman lived. She had chanced upon her at
barely the right time to secure her continuing to
live; she had saved her from suicide, kept her alive
to shackle Rodney, according to the law which had
bound them together, but had given her another
chance for Eternal Life. Now she lay within the
spotless physical and spiritual purity of the House
of the Good Shepherd. It was Cicely Adair, who
had been so sore beset with temptation to marry
this woman’s husband, who had been allowed to
lead her inside the Good Shepherd’s field where she
might, if she would, become that sheep which He
bore upon His shoulders into safety.</p>

<p>Cicely’s bright head bowed on the window sill;
her breath came short; her cheeks grew wet with
tears such as she had never before shed, as the
realization came to her that this was her superabounding
reward. Because she had renounced
Rodney for God’s sake, He was making her as the
little crook which He laid around the neck of Rodney’s
errant wife, compelling her to turn and return.</p>

<p>Cis rose up at last when Nan, unable to leave her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
to herself longer, came softly knocking at her door,
and, with a loving kiss, laid the baby in Cicely’s
arms, offering her thus the best clue that she knew
to the mysteries of life, the sweetest panacea for
its ills. And as she did so, Nan, with a sudden
sinking of heart, was sure that Cis would marry
Rodney; that his wife would die and she would
marry him, because she had known what it was to
worship at the shrine of this baby.</p>

<p>Cis had little to say to Nan of the tremendous
experience of that day; what was there to
say? It was far too great for comment, and of
the possible import of it, its strange connection
with her recent past, Cis had no desire to talk
to Nan. She did go with it to Jeanette Lucas,
whose understanding was perfect, but to her Cis
found herself unequal to say much. She wrote
to Father Morley, and received from him a long letter
that formulated and expressed for Cis all that
she had been trying to correlate in herself. However,
it was in her daily visits to the House of the
Good Shepherd that Cis received the best fruit of
these experiences.</p>

<p>Every day Cis made time to go to see Myrtle
Moore, and every day she sat for a while with the
white robed nun whom they called Sister Bonaventure,
properly so called her, Cis thought, for her
coming was always good for her.</p>

<p>She was wise with a wisdom that must have been
the direct reception of that gift from the Holy
Ghost, for she “had entered religion,” she told Cis,
at twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>She had spent but one year at home after her
graduation from a convent school, so that she had
encountered nothing of the world’s wickedness and
weakness, yet she seemed to have plumbed the
depths of the science of souls; her talk was illuminative
and tonic to Cis.</p>

<p>“Will she die, Sister?” Cis asked, speaking of
their patient.</p>

<p>“Surely; we all shall,” smiled the nun. “But
yes; I think Myrtle will not live long. You see,
she has used up all her capital of strength, burned
it like a fuel that yields cold, not heat. I think she
will not last long.”</p>

<p>“And will she die well—sorry, you know?” Cis
hesitated; she found it hard to talk of Rodney’s
wife’s state, even to Sister Bonaventure.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Sister Bonaventure with her
smile, which Cis found at once illuminative and
baffling, “as to that we can only pray and hope;
pray that she may have the grace she so sorely
needs; hope that when she receives the sacraments
they may have the soil to work on in which they always
are fruitful. The poor things who die in our
infirmary rarely refuse the last offices, and we try
to make them fit to receive them; after that—”
Sister Bonaventure waved her hands expressing the
Infinite Mercy, and the incomprehensibility of
human minds. “I think they are probably sorry,
and God is anxious to go half-way to meet a parting
soul. Habit dulls us all; perhaps God has to
come farther toward all of us than we think He
does, even to the best of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“What a miracle to be where Myrtle Moore was,
yet to die with you Sisters praying around her!”
cried Cis, tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“What a miracle it is to die anywhere, yet with
immortality and infinity around us!” cried Sister
Bonaventure. “Cicely, we are so surrounded with
miracles, so accustomed to handling them, that we
are obtuse! Now, my dear, this woman’s former
husband, who is still her husband, for they were
married by a priest, and their divorce does not
touch the fact—what about him? He should be
sent for, if she grows as much worse within a week
as our doctor and our Sister Infirmarian expects
her to. She does not know where he is, and we are
completely at sea as to how to look for him. Could
you make a suggestion?”</p>

<p>“Did you know, Sister, that I was going to marry
him, not knowing that he had ever been married?
And that he would not deceive me, so, at the last
minute—our home was preparing—he told me that
he was divorced?” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“Was that the way of it?” asked Sister Bonaventure
serenely. “No, I did not know anything
whatever, but I surmised that there was something
to know, that your interest in the patient was not
fully explained by your rescue of her. Have you
his address, my dear?”</p>

<p>“He can always be reached through his firm, the
main house, in Chicago,” replied Cis. “I have that
address; yes, Sister. Shall I give it to you?”</p>

<p>She wondered at the matter-of-course way in
which the nun received her brief statement that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
she had almost, though innocently, married a man
already married. She had not dealt enough with
the Religious of her faith to know that they rarely
seem to be surprised by human vagaries, and still
more rarely betray a shock.</p>

<p>“No, on the whole, I think it were better that you
should write,” said Sister Bonaventure. “Mr.
Moore might not come if we wrote him. He has
divorced the woman, and it is not likely that he
feels tolerant of her sins against him. If you write
to him, telling him how you saved her from death
by her own hand, and that he must come at once to
see her, bid her farewell, and forgive her, that she
may die in peace, hoping for a higher forgiveness,
I think that he may come on. Especially that you
have a claim upon him for the wrong that he so
nearly did you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sister, you don’t, you can’t ask me to write
to him!” cried Cis. “How can I write him? And
what may he not think? That I want to see him,
even that I may—”</p>

<p>“You will write to him as a disembodied spirit
would write; you can easily show him your motive.
You really cannot refuse to write. The poor woman
wants to see him, to receive his pardon; she cannot
die in peace without it. I must tell you that we did
write to him, to Beaconhite. We know that the letter
was forwarded, for otherwise it was to have been
returned in three days. He has not replied in any
way. You must write, Cicely; you must still further
help Myrtle to die. As to the man’s misinterpreting
you, that will not outlast his coming, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
cannot harm you. If I did not know that you were
wholly free from personal desire in the matter, I
would not let you write. I have watched you, talking
with you, and I understand you. As it is, I ask
you to write—at once.”</p>

<p>“I will!” cried Cis, swayed to Sister Bonaventure’s
will by something in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sister Bonaventure, if you know me—and
you do!—could I be one of you here? Or a nun
anywhere? Am I fit to be? It is so lofty, so peaceful,
so blessed!”</p>

<p>“You are entirely fit, my child, but not in the
least fitted,” said the nun, with the smile that drew
hearts to her. “It is not that the best come here,
but the called come. The life is all that you say it
is, but peace is denied to no one who follows after
it. You do not belong with us, dear Cicely; not in
any Community, but in a home whence you will
overflow to bring happiness and help into other
lives.”</p>

<p>“As though you nuns didn’t!” sighed Cis, rising
to go.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I know. Little mirrors reflect wherever
they are hung! Good-bye, my dear. Write
that letter to-night and dispatch it,” said Sister
Bonaventure.</p>

<p>Cis wrote when she got back to her room at
Nan’s. She did not let herself pause for an instant
to remember that she was writing to Rodney—again!</p>

<p>“Dear Rodney;” she wrote. “Myrtle Moore,
your wife, is here, in this city. I came upon her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
the park just as she was putting to her lips the
deadly poison which was to kill her. I knocked the
bottle from her hand. I took her to the House of
the Good Shepherd. She is seriously ill there; dying.
She cannot die without begging your forgiveness.
Come on at once and give it to her. We shall
all need mercy one day, as we have all done wrong.
Come at once. Remember that Myrtle is still your
wife. Think of her as she was when you first knew
her; she is now a wreck, suffering, wretched, dying.
Do not lose a day. You must see in this the Hand
of God: that she had wandered here; that I came
back here; that it was I who saved her from suicide
to die with the sacraments, hope and sorrow in her
miserable heart. If there is anything that I could
add to urge you to come, I would add it, but what
more is there? A woman whom you once loved, an
outcast, broken-down, dying, begging your forgiveness!
It is miserably sad, but still more pitiable;
you are kind, Rodney; you will not say no. And
God let me save her from a dreadful end, <i>me</i>,
Cicely Adair.”</p>

<p>Cis read her letter several times, then she took it
to Jeanette Lucas to read.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell whether it is right or wrong,” Cis
said imploringly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you could better it, dear. What
can you do except lay before him the facts? He
cannot refuse such a request as this, and from you!
How strange it all is! Cis, when he comes—what?”
Jeanette waited for Cis’s answer.</p>

<p>It came at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“Yes, what?” Cis echoed. “I don’t want to see
him. Will you hide me, Jeanette?”</p>

<p>“But you know when this poor Myrtle is dead—”
Jeanette stopped.</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” cried Cis. “What a curiously
tangled web! I wonder why?”</p>

<p>“It is not tangled,” Jeanette reminded her. “It
looks so to us; I’m sure the tangle is part of the pattern.”</p>

<p>Three days must pass before Rodney could reply
to Cicely’s letter, and that would be making the
best time possible for a letter to travel in each direction.
It would be longer, if he were coming; time
must be allowed, in either case, for Cicely’s letter to
be forwarded to him. They were hard days to live
through; dread, expectation, perhaps fear is not too
strong a word, were in the air that Cis breathed;
she spent the hours in feverish nervousness. And
Myrtle was rapidly growing worse.</p>

<p>On the fourth day Rodney came. It was evening,
and Cis was sitting with Nan under the light
of her reading lamp, in her sitting room, when they
heard Joe open the front door and tell someone to
“walk right in.”</p>

<p>Before they had time to be startled by the realization
that the step was not Tom’s, whom they had
expected to see, Rodney Moore stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>Nan had seen him but once; however, she instantly
recognized him and sprang up with an inarticulate
sound that was almost a shocked cry. Cis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
sat still, staring up at him, her work fallen into her
lap.</p>

<p>Rodney had changed; he looked older, worn,
hard. Cis instantly felt great pity for him, but it
was mingled with amazement that she had so lately
found him all that was attractive in man. Something
stood between them that was not the dying
Myrtle. Cis had learned, had absorbed other
standards of excellence than Rodney’s since she
had parted from him; they asserted themselves
without her volition, her consciousness of their
presence.</p>

<p>“Cis!” said Rodney hoarsely, and Cis became
aware that she had not spoken.</p>

<p>“Yes, Rodney. I am thankful that you have
come,” Cis said.</p>

<p>She arose, went forward and gave Rodney an icy
hand.</p>

<p>“I will telephone the Sisters and ask when you
are to go to see Myrtle. She has sunk fast for two
days; I found her quite low when I went there this
afternoon, but they think that she is fighting to
hold herself alive till you get here. Perhaps you
must go there to-night.” Cis turned toward the
telephone in the corner.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Cis, is this all that you have
to say to me after—” Rodney’s angry grief stopped
his utterance.</p>

<p>“That I am thankful that you have come? That
I will help you at once to accomplish what you
came for? What else is there to say, Rodney?” Cis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
asked quietly, and took down the telephone receiver.</p>

<p>“Have I no claim? Am I no more than an undertaker,
called in to lay out that miserable
woman?” Rodney almost shouted.</p>

<p>Cis turned toward him and raised her hand.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for my connection; please be
quiet,” she said. “You have a claim upon my pity
and help; I am giving you both.”</p>

<p>Rodney stared at her as she turned back to the
instrument and talked for a short time to someone
on the other end of the wire. Cis hung up, and
came back to the middle of the room, leaning her
hand on the table as if she were tired.</p>

<p>“You are to go to the Good Shepherd to-night,”
she said. “The Sister Infirmarian says that you
have not come too soon. If Nan will give you supper
we will start immediately after you have eaten.
I will take you there, unless you prefer to go alone.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go alone; I’m afraid,” Rodney groaned.</p>

<p>Gentle Nan went over to him as she heard his
boyish cry. She began to hope that Cicely would
comfort him, as she alone could do, and lead him
back to God, which seemed to her preëminently
Cicely’s grace.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any supper, but have you coffee?”
Rodney asked, and Nan hurried away to make it,
followed by Cis, who had no mind to linger with
Rodney alone.</p>

<p>Joe called a taxi; the coffee was quickly made on
the gas range, and drunk. Cis found herself whirling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
as in a dream through the streets, beside Rodney.</p>

<p>He groped for her hand, but Cis withheld it.</p>

<p>“There is no you nor I, Rodney,” she said
sternly. “Myrtle is dying. Pray that you may be
able to help her out of the world which she has
tragically spoiled for herself, for you, and for who
can say how many others? Pray hard that you and
she, both, may be allowed to atone.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that I am partly responsible for
her wickedness?” Rodney demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, oh, I don’t know; I hope not,”
said Cis wearily. “I’m beginning to see that we
are almost always sharer in a wrong that is within
our own radius. We are so slow to see, so indifferent
to save.”</p>

<p>The taxi stopped at the door of the House of the
Good Shepherd, which opened at once to admit Cis
and Rodney.</p>

<p>“Yes, very low,” the Sister answered Cicely’s
question. “They say she will die to-night. She has
made her confession, and received the last rites;
she is conscious and lies watching the door for her
husband to come.”</p>

<p>Rodney felt the word like a cord around him.
None of these Catholics, whom he had tried to
leave behind him, but who were again interwoven
into his life, heeded the decree of divorce which
annulled for him his title of husband. How unbending,
everlasting, certain, were the ways of
Rome even in all her least, most distant avenues!</p>

<p>“Oh, Rod!” Myrtle breathed his name as he entered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
“Now I’ll die. Maybe it’s true God will
forgive me, if you can. You’re harder than God.
I’m sorry, honest. Forgive me, Roddie?”</p>

<p>Rodney looked down on her; at the fluttering
hand feebly extended toward him; at the face which
he had known young and pretty, now wasted, consumed
by Myrtle’s life, the life now panting toward
its final breath.</p>

<p>A great pity came upon him. There, on the
other side of the bed, knelt Cis, the stainless girl
whom he loved, her face white and tear-wet, sweet
and grave with pity, and pain, and fear.</p>

<p>Who was he to condemn, to refuse mercy? Did
he not need it, too? Had his life been so far beyond
reproach? Cis, kneeling there, thought that
he was worse than Myrtle, for she had sinned, but
was absolved. She had broken God’s laws, but he
had turned his back on God coldly, deliberately.
And he had not confessed himself a sinner. He
was not a hard-hearted man, and the awfulness of
what lay there before him, what awaited Myrtle,
now hoping for Rodney’s pardon, so soon to stand
before God for His sentence, melted him, broke
down his anger against his wife.</p>

<p>Rodney knelt beside the bed, and took the fluttering
hand, folding its feeble fingers within his
own.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Myrtie; don’t worry,” he said. “I’ll
forgive everything, and I’m sorry if I ever drove
you an inch on your road. It’s all right, poor girl.
Go to sleep and take your rest.”</p>

<p>“Well, God bless you, Rod!” sighed Myrtle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
“I’m going to sleep; pray I’ll rest.” Beside that bed
for three hours Cis, Myrtle’s divorced husband,
who at last realized that there was no divorce but
the one Myrtle, slipping away, was giving him, and
a Sister recited the prayers for a parting soul. At
the first hour of the morning the soul quietly, with
a few deep drawn breaths, parted.</p>

<p>Rodney went back to Nan’s in the taxi with Cis.
They did not speak during the drive. But as Rodney
opened the door for Cis with her pass key, he
put out his hand and Cis laid hers in it without a
word.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the hotel. To-morrow I’ll attend
to things, then—May I see you, Cis?” Rodney
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll see you, Rodney—to say good-bye,”
Cis answered.</p>

<p>“I’ve no right to complain of that,” Rodney said
humbly. “You’re a good girl, Cis. Whatever had
been, you would have been too good for me. I’m
thankful to you, Cis, for to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m thankful to God. Good night, Rodney,”
said Cis.</p>

THE NEXT STEP</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the remnant of that night left for sleep
Cis slept deeply, too tired in mind and body
to be wakeful.</p>

<p>Her hours at the telephone exchange were elastic;
she had undertaken the organization work only
on a provisory basis, unwillingly, with the understanding
that it might continue in her hands but a
short time. She called up her own department in
the morning and said that she would not go down
until after lunch. She knew that Rodney would
come to see her, probably in the forenoon. She
knew that she must not refuse to see him. He had
done right because she had asked it of him; the
least that she could do was to repay that debt by
bidding him good-bye, this time, she was sure, for
all the rest of her life. She dreaded the interview,
yet dreaded it less than she had expected to. Her
experience with Rodney had been marked by extremes
of emotion, even up to the previous night
when, by a strange combination of circumstances,
she and he had watched his wife die while they
responded to the prayers for mercy upon her. Now
Cis stood upon the plane of quiet. There remained
but to drop the curtain upon this drama in her life,
with a Godspeed for poor Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>Little Nan went about with an awe-struck, frightened
face as the morning hours passed and Cis
awaited Rodney. Nothing dramatic had ever come
within the sweet little woman’s orbit; she did not
know how to bear herself as a sort of fringe upon
Cicely’s tragic cloak.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay in the room, or keep away, just as you
say, Cis—I mean when he comes,” Nan said. “I
don’t know what is done in these cases.”</p>

<p>Cis laughed; being Cis she would always laugh at
anything funny.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they set down rules for ‘these
cases’ in books of etiquette, Nan! But I wouldn’t
like to give Rodney an audience; you and I are another
matter,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” cried Nan fervently. “I’d
be so scared I’d probably crawl under the sofa!”</p>

<p>“Which would do no one else any good, and muss
up your hair dreadfully,” Cis suggested.</p>

<p>When the bell rang it was nearly noon. Nan
fled to open the door, and then to escape. Cis had
been holding the sleepy baby, and when Rodney
entered she had risen to meet him, little Matt held
in her arm, which could not quite support his white
kid-shod feet. His rosy face was pressed against
Cis’s breast; his half-open eyes regarded the
stranger with a languid interest that suggested a
verdict on him, rendered after a nap had been completed.</p>

<p>The doorway framed this sweet picture of poignant
suggestions; Rodney halted and stood gazing
at it motionless, silent, his face working with pain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
He came forward and put out his hand. Cicely laid
hers in it, then withdrew it and turned to resume
her chair, wondering if Nan would fetch away the
baby.</p>

<p>“Take that more comfortable seat, Rodney,” she
said. “This is my godson; we are on the best of
terms.”</p>

<p>“I am going away on the train that leaves here
for Chicago at eight minutes to two,” Rodney said,
ignoring all extrinsic subjects. “Myrtle’s people
replied to a telegram from me that she might be
buried in their family lot; they live about fifteen
miles outside Chicago. The Sisters sent them word
that Myrtle was in their hands, dying; they did not
reply. Neither did I reply to a letter from the
Sisters. You made me come on. Queer, isn’t it,
that I, who am no relation to her, and you who
never knew her, are the only ones to see Myrtle out
off the earth, and decently put into it?” Rodney
spoke with a visible effort.</p>

<p>“You are related to her; you two were made one
flesh,” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Well, Cis, I’m going to own up! The Church
is right. I’ve been feeling that. Myrtle separated
herself from me by a chasm that no honorable man
would cross; that’s all so. But the state did not
divorce me from her; it couldn’t. If marriage
asserts itself, in spite of that impassable chasm of
disgrace and infamy, as it surely does, then it’s beyond
the reach of the state. You were right; I was
wrong. If we had been married last night, kneeling
beside Myrtle, neither of us could have borne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
it. Curious, isn’t it? But you were right. Is it
any satisfaction to you to have me acknowledge it?
I hope it is. I was furiously, bitterly angry with
you, Cis, but you were right. I’m able to see now
that it cost you high to choose as you did.”</p>

<p>“It hurt, Rodney,” said Cis simply. “I don’t suppose
I should say now that it cost me high; I realize
that I made a tremendous purchase at a low rate.
I’ve been thinking how strange it is: You are taking
Myrtle’s body to Chicago, then to her own
people!”</p>

<p>“On that eight minutes to two,” Rodney corroborated
her.</p>

<p>“Yes. How strange it is that you have come to
say good-bye to me, and are going away with Myrtle,
after all,” Cis completed her thought.</p>

<p>“But, Cis, it is not reunited to her,” Rodney protested.
“It is recognition that the divorce did not
set me free to marry you, but there was far more
than any decree separating me from Myrtle. And
therefore there is no reason for conventionality, no
reason for assuming that my wife has just died, and
that I am on my way to bury her. I am not; I am
seeing her looked after and I grant you I could not
marry again on my divorce, yet there’s no wife of
mine newly dead, either. Cis, now I am free. Now
the Church puts no barrier between us. You can
be as Catholic as you will, and yet marry me.
There’s nothing to wait for; we’ve spent a long probation.
When, Cis?”</p>

<p>“Never, Rodney,” said Cis quietly. “I hoped you
understood that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>“I understood that you wanted me to understand
it when you told me you’d see me to say good-bye.
You couldn’t have expected me to go off on a hint!
Why won’t you marry me, Cis? You have changed
enormously, but I know you’re not fickle, not easily
moved, either way. You still love me?” Rodney
pleaded.</p>

<p>“No, Rodney, I don’t,” Cis said. “It amazes me
to find that you stir memories of feeling, but no
feeling. Don’t you think, perhaps, there is a reaction
from intense pain that produces in the mind
something like the immunity that a violent sickness
produces in the physical system? I was dashed to
pieces, and the reassembled person has lost the
vibration to your personality.”</p>

<p>“Merciful powers! Cis!” cried Rodney, honestly
disgusted. “You talking philosophy, or psychology,
or some other rotten, cold-blooded analysis!
You, glowing, red-haired, my Holly? That
high-browed crowd you’ve gone in with at Beaconhite
have cold packed you!”</p>

<p>Cis smiled faintly. “I’m no colder than I ever
was—”</p>

<p>“Except to me!” Rodney interrupted her. “Don’t
tell me that I don’t remember—”</p>

<p>“Except to you,” Cis interrupted in her turn, her
color heightened. “I have grown up, and we are no
longer possible chums. It happens often enough
that people grow apart, even when they’re married.
When it has happened to two people who are free,
there can be, there should be, no talk of marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
between them. We must say good-bye, Rodney, as
you came to say it.”</p>

<p>“As you told me to come to say it; I didn’t mean
to say it,” Rodney pulled on a chain from inside his
breast, and held up to Cis her ruby holly ring. “I
wear it, but take it back, Cis!” he begged.</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor, lovely ring!” Cis cried. “I will
never take it back. Oh, Rodney, we had not planned
for the true Christmas when I wore that! Give the
ruby to be set in a chalice, or sell it, and send the
money to take care of some helpless baby who may
never know that Our Lord was a baby! Let it make
a trifling reparation for us both.”</p>

<p>Rodney stared, but this suggestion seemed to convince
him that between him and Cis stretched unbridgeable
distances.</p>

<p>“Well, you have got it bad!” he said slowly, not
so much irreverently as in a puzzled way, expressing
himself in the vernacular of his custom.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s natural to want to pay
back?” Cis suggested. “If the Church were not
true, she could not be so beautiful, and you do ‘have
it bad,’ as you say, when you love anything that is
wholly true and profoundly beautiful. Rodney,
truly you don’t begin to know! I wish you would—at
least begin to know! Did you ever read about
those poor animals which have been shut down in
mines, how they act when they come up into the
sunshine, into green fields again? Quite mad with
the warmth, and brightness, and pasturage? I’m
like that. I went along, didn’t know what I was
missing, but now I know what I have! Will you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
promise me, Rodney, solemnly promise me, now,
to-day when we part, that you will do your best to
learn what your birthright is which you threw
away?”</p>

<p>Rodney Moore looked long and mutely at Cis,
frowning, biting his lip; she had silenced his pleas
for his personal desires. She waited for his answer.</p>

<p>At last it came.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Rodney said. “I will look into it thoroughly.
It must be a big thing to do what it did
last night. And to you—though that’s another
story. It hit me when you would not marry me,
stuck to the Church, though you didn’t seem to
care much about her. I know a chap who is a
Dominican in Chicago; he and I were confirmed together.
I’ll hunt him up. It’s a promise.”</p>

<p>“Then God bless you, Rodney, and I’ll pray for
you hard. It’s good-bye, now, isn’t it? I heard the
Angelus from our church faintly ever so long ago,”
said Cis, rising.</p>

<p>Rodney pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>“I’ll say it was long ago!” he cried. “I’ll have to
eat on the train. But it won’t take me long to connect
with my bag at the hotel. Everything else is
done. Cis, good-bye. Oh, Cis, good-bye! Not for
always? Let me come again!”</p>

<p>“Better not, Rodney. I’m not going to stay here,
though; not long. I think this time it is for always,
yet we may meet again; there should be many days
before we are old. Truly God bless you, Rodney,”
said Cis, holding out her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>Their hands met over the sleeping baby; he
seemed like a figure of their complete separation,
filling the place of the child who would never be.</p>

<p>“Kiss me, Holly,” Rodney whispered.</p>

<p>“Our hands hold all that we give,” Cicely answered,
and once more he bowed to her will.</p>

<p>“I shall remember you looking like a madonna.
Good-bye, good-bye, ah, Cis, good-bye!” Rodney
lifted to his cheek the hand he held, then laid it
upon the child’s breast, beside its mate.</p>

<p>Cis stood motionless after the front door closed,
till Nan came creeping into the room and little Matt
stirred with a complaining cry.</p>

<p>Rodney had gone, gone with Myrtle, dead, to
bury her; deeper still to bury his hope and love of
Cicely. Nothing was left of Rodney Moore except
his promise to her. But that promise filled Cis with
exaltation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning Cis made it on her way to her
office to go to see Jeanette Lucas, though it was a
détour that took her in the opposite direction for
several blocks.</p>

<p>“Cis, I wanted to see you; did you sense it?”
Jeanette cried as she came in. “I’ve something
wonderful, marvellous to tell you. You remember
Paul Ralph Randolph?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I do,” said Cis. “Didn’t he
tour New England with Mr. Lancaster last summer,
keeping with Miss Braithwaite’s car? I rode with
him lots of times, and had fine talks. He’s the convert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
minister who has been so fine about it; I mean
sacrifices and all that.”</p>

<p>“Surely! Cis, he’s a confessor of the faith! He’s
almost a martyr for it! He’s perfectly glorious!”
cried Jeanette.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard all that; everybody has, of course.
You don’t know him, do you?” Cis asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cicely Adair! He told me that he had
talked to you of me!” Jeanette looked aggrieved. “I
met him in England; he crossed with us coming
home. He was received in England, because it was
easier. His father and mother behaved violently
about his coming over to the Church, when he announced
that he intended to come, so he went
across, and he was received by the Benedictines
over there. Don’t you remember? I must have
spoken of it, and he himself told you that he knew
me! What a girl! Did you remember everything
he told you of Mr. Lancaster? Paul says—”</p>

<p>“Hallo! <i>Who</i> says?” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s my news!” Jeanette triumphed over
her. “<i>Paul</i> says, <i>Paul</i>, whom I’m going to marry!
Paul Ralph Randolph, the confessor, and almost
martyr!”</p>

<p>“Martyr nothing!” Cis relapsed under the shock
into her earlier habits of speech.</p>

<p>“He’s no martyr if he marries you, Jeanette
Lucas! You’re too lovely to marry any mere man.
I always did think you were superfinely fine! But
this is great news, my dearest, and nobody is
gladder than red-haired Cis!”</p>

<p>“Nobody is nicer than red-haired Cis!” retorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
Jeanette. “I was afraid you’d be a little shocked,
because you knew I was engaged before. But, Cis,
though it hurt me dreadfully when you let me discover
Herbert Dale’s character, and I was wretched
after it, it was the sickness of disenchantment; the
shock cured me of all love for him. I half hoped
I might be a nun; I spoke of it to you once, but it
isn’t my place. When Paul asked me to marry him—three
days ago; he wrote me—I knew how I loved
him; I hadn’t realized it before. Oh, my dear, I’m
so happy and so humbled!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind how happy you are, but not
humbled,” Cis protested, kissing her over and over
again.</p>

<p>“And I want you happy, splendid Cicely,” Jeanette
murmured.</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that, I’m sure to be; it’s the temperament
of my hair,” said Cis, turning away slightly.
“But I’d like to be useful, fill a place, find the right
place to fill. Sister Bonaventure says no habit for
poor Cicely! I wonder what I’m meant for; nothing
in particular, probably. Reliable secretary,
run a typewriter accurately, get under the skins of
youngsters when they need entertaining! Well, it’s
at least a harmless life.”</p>

<p>There was a note in Cicely’s voice new to it.
Jeanette instantly pounced upon her. “Lonely,
Cis? Not perfectly happy? These past days made
things harder? They’ve been cruelly hard in themselves,
I’m sure of that!”</p>

<p>Cis swung around to face her.</p>

<p>“It’s not that I still want Rod; don’t think that!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
she cried. “I knew I didn’t, but I know it better
now. These days were hard, but they were a comfort,
too. I’m not lonely, not exactly; perhaps, a
little. I don’t know what I want. I miss Miss
Braithwaite, my life with her. Perfectly happy?
I’m twenty-three; the ‘first fine careless rapture’
is over then, I suppose. I want a place to fill; I
want a work to do that will take every bit of me to
do it.”</p>

<p>Cis quoting Browning? Cis half pensive, unsatisfied?
Jeanette wondered.</p>

<p>“Poor Cicely! I suspect if we put a dynamo to
grinding coffee it would find the grains small and
the dust they made too trivial!” Jeanette said. “But
you take my engagement coolly! Aren’t you
amazed?”</p>

<p>“I’m wholly amazed and surprised, and I take it
less coolly than you think,” declared Cis. “It has
rather bowled me over. I suppose I dread to have
you married. Where shall you live, Jeanette,
dear?”</p>

<p>“In Beaconhite. Paul is going into literary work
there; he says I shall help him. And he is going
to teach Greek and Latin in that big boys’ school on
the outskirts of the city—Graycliff Hall—and he’ll
probably lecture. It will be Beaconhite,” Jeanette
answered.</p>

<p>Cis’s face had brightened as she listened.</p>

<p>“I know I’m going back there, somehow,” she declared.
“That’s good news that you’ll be within
reach. I’m hungry for Beaconhite.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Wilmer is ready for you at any moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
whoever he has as his secretary,” Jeanette assured
her. “He told me that he would pension his secretary,
if he must, and would have you back any
day you’d come. He will be received into the
Church at Pentecost, Cis; Father Morley will receive
him, as he did father, and father will make a
point of being here in time for the ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Was there a secret about your father’s going
away; ought I ask?” hinted Cis.</p>

<p>“He was seriously ill. We told no one, lest
mother hear of it; things have such a way of leaking,
unexplainably! He was supposed to be travelling
on matters connected with important affairs
of business. He has been in a sanitarium. He is
cured, thank God! Even now don’t speak of this,
Cis. Miss Gallatin knows, hardly anyone else.
Hannah Gallatin is a great woman!” Jeanette
ended with tears of gratitude and relief in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I never see her, lately; I wish I might,” said
Cis. “I believe she could set me up again with my
old sensible way of taking things!”</p>

<p>“She’s not here now. I’ll tell her you need her
for a—what do they call it?—a pick-me-up?” Jeanette
laughed.</p>

<p>That evening Tom came into Nan’s house as was
his custom. Though Cis had bade him cease to hope
for her love, and Nan had confirmed the hopelessness,
yet as long as Cis was free, it was hard for
Tom to give her up, and wholly impossible to stay
away from her.</p>

<p>“Well,” the boy began as he came in, “I saw
something pretty decent to-night. A man came in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
on the 7:56 train; I was at the station. He was
great, the kind everybody turns to look at; tall,
well-dressed, about forty, maybe, and—I don’t
know! Great; that’s about the word. You wanted
to speak to him, and shake hands with him. He
talked something like an Englishman, not quite—”</p>

<p>“What did he look like?” cried Cis.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve been telling you, haven’t I?” Tom
spoke in an aggrieved tone. “I don’t know the color
of his eyes, or anything of that sort. Handsome,
I’d say, but more sort of splendid. He had another
man with him, nice chap, too. Well, sir,
there was a raggedy old woman hanging around,
trying to find out something about trains, or farming,
for all I know; nobody could make her out.
She had a bag as big as a Noë’s ark, and a regular
eruption of bundles! A fresh boy thought it was
funny to hustle her, hit up against her, and she
dropped the bundles, bag, whole shooting match,
all over everything! The bag bulged queer clothes—it
burst open—and the bundles opened up, or
two did, and out of one there sort of flowed a lot
of carrots, and out of the other a white kitten got
away! Don’t ask me how she had it done up, for
I’ll never tell you! Everybody howled laughing,
but what do you think that man did?”</p>

<p>“Helped her!” cried Cis, and she looked triumphant
and excited.</p>

<p>“Rather! Caught the kitten and stroked it quiet;
the little thing took to him as if he’d been the
mother cat! Gathered up carrots with the other
hand, and, in the mean time, talked to the old dame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
in her own tongue—Italian—and put her wise to
whatever she was trying to find out! I got in on
bundling the clothes back into the bag, and the
carrots into the bundle, and the kitten into a basket,
which my knight of distressed dames bought at the
fruit stand; he tied it down so strong that the kitten
is sure to arrive wherever it’s going! And I’m betting
that most of the people around there felt good
and ashamed of themselves! It isn’t much to tell,
but somehow it was a lot to see. There wasn’t a
person in that waiting room that didn’t think that
man was the greatest ever; you could feel the way
the thing grabbed ’em. I tell you the truth! Of
course I was sorry for the old person, and sorry I’d
laughed at her, and I did want to make good by
helping her out, but I wanted more to be working
with that man so that he’d speak to me! He did
speak, too! And I leave it to you if a fellow like
me often feels that way to a man, a perfect stranger,
just happening to come off the train in the station?”</p>

<p>“Magnetism,” murmured Joe.</p>

<p>“There’s only one man in all the world like
that!” cried Cis.</p>

<p>Tom turned on her sharply.</p>

<p>“Know him?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Of course I can’t be sure, but it is exactly like
Mr. Anselm Lancaster, and it is like no one else in
all the world!” Cis said, her eyes bright, her face
flushed, her breath a little quickened.</p>

<p>“He is the one whom everybody looks at; when
he comes into a room you feel him as much as you
see him. He can make anything trust him, kittens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
carrots, old women, anything! He speaks Italian
as well as English, and he speaks English like an
Oxford Englishman. He would do precisely what
you describe, be a knight errant as soon for a poor
old immigrant as for a princess! It sounds like no
one but Mr. Anselm Lancaster!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

THE BEACON</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PRECISELY because she wanted exceedingly to
stay away from the girls and neglect the arrangement
of their new rooms in the telephone
building, Cis arose betimes the next morning and
went out early. She could not rid herself of the
conviction that the man whose chivalry had so impressed
Tom the previous night was Anselm Lancaster,
and she wanted to stay in the house, hoping
that, if it were he, he would come to look her up.
It had been long, and seemed longer to Cis, since
she had heard from Miss Braithwaite. Mr. Lancaster
had shown no remembrance of her existence
for months; it was now close upon May day, and
spring in the air increased Cis’s restless dissatisfaction,
filling her with a homesickness which was
farther reaching and deeper than homesickness for
a definite place.</p>

<p>She told herself that it was absurd to identify
Tom’s hero on so slender a ground, and quite unpardonable
to mope around the house expecting
Mr. Lancaster to call on her. “You never were
silly when it was the time to be silly; don’t begin it
now, Cis Adair,” she sternly told herself.</p>

<p>So she went down to look after her girls’ organization
earlier than usual, in order to rebuke her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
own tendency to folly, but, like most of us, she compromised
with her weakness.</p>

<p>“I’m not coming back to lunch, Nancy,” she
casually told Nan. “I’ve looked up that bunch of
little ragamuffin newsies I used to chum with before
I went away. I could not find them all, but I found
two or three, and they’ll find the rest—one, Tony,
whom I liked a great deal, is dead, poor little chap;
was run over by a motor truck, they tell me. I’ve
been thinking I missed my chance to do more than
amuse them and give them a little pleasure when I
was here; I’m going to see if I can make amends.
I told them I’d give them the price of their papers
if they’d spend the afternoon with me, take a holiday.
They didn’t seem to object! I’m going to
take them out to the picnic glen on a hike, and give
them a good time—I hope! I went out there yesterday
and hid tin boxes, filled with candy, around
in the rocks, and under the shrubbery, enough for
each to have one; they’ll have to divide fairly if
anybody finds more than one. And when they’ve
worked down some of their spirits I’m going to tell
them a story, and lead up to my point—missionary
point, you know! Good plan?”</p>

<p>“It’s a dear plan, Cis!” cried Nan. “What a Cis
you are! I’d like to be good your way!”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks! My way is to try to make up the
least bit for not being half-way good, never once
caring to give the little chaps a push in the right direction.
You don’t have to pay up for lost chances,
Nan,” cried Cis impatiently. “I could have done
almost anything with those boys then. Well, that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
milk that is not only spilled, but soaked down into
the ground; no use crying over it. If you need me,
Nan, if the baby begins to talk, or has the croup, or
anything like that, you’ll find me at the picnic
glen.”</p>

<p>Cis laughed, a little shame-facedly as she made it
clear to Nan where not only she, but anyone else
who happened to want her might find her.</p>

<p>At half past one Cis, with a fringe on her garment’s
edge, of small boys, and a few larger ones,
went briskly swinging out toward the pretty country
which surrounded the little city. They were bound
on a four mile walk; they would end it, at the pace
they were taking it, in something over an hour and
a quarter. Cis ordered her troop to sing, herself
leading the dubious chorus, sung in as many variations
of key and tune as was possible to the number
singing. The words held most of the time in
place; even little flat-faced Jimmy Devlin, who
sang on one note, situated in the depth of his diapraghm,
kept valiantly to the time, so the tortured
music held the feet to their task.</p>

<p>The glen was really pretty. It was damp and
fragrant with the spring moisture and odors; with
the delicious earth newly released from frost, the
little shoots, the new growths of bark; somewhere
out of sight were violets, and on the rocks saxifrage,
clustering tiny white stars on an erect stem.</p>

<p>The boys’ delight was satisfying even to Cis, who
passionately longed to put four hours and better of
unadulterated joy into these meagre little lives.
They went on a violent hunt for her hidden boxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
of candy, unearthed them, every one, and willingly
gave each boy who had been slower than the rest
the share which he had failed to discover. They
played games, yelling like mad, till, at last, they
were ready to drop down on the platform put up
for dancing, upon which Cis insisted as a seat because
the high temperature of this summerlike
April day had not had time to dry the wet ground.
They subsided to munch candy and let her have
her way with them.</p>

<p>Cis had carefully planned her story, and she
told it well, the story of an imaginary little Roman
boy, who might have lived, who dearly loved
St. Sebastian. She told them how this brave young
soldier and his little friend had died, for she
made her fictitious little citizen of the City of the
Catacombs share the fate of the older youth, whose
story was true.</p>

<p>Then leaning toward the lads whose eyes were
fixed upon her own, clasping her hands, her eager
face flushed and earnest, her glorious red hair shining
under a ray of sunshine until it seemed to illumine
the shady glen, Cis begged her little adorers
to hold fast to that for which Sebastian’s arrows had
been faced, for which those little lads of old—and
many since—had truly lived and gladly died.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Anselm Lancaster, coming down
the glen from behind her, found Cis, and paused to
wonder, with reverence added to the admiration he
had already learned to feel for her.</p>

<p>One of the boys discovered him, and started up
from his prone position, with a threatening gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>“Who’s de guy? Here, this is a private show;
no buttin’ in!” he cried.</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster laughed, and came forward as
Cis leaped up and faced him, knowing at the first
syllable of her indignant little guest’s protest, whom
she should see.</p>

<p>“It is a mean trick to butt in, I’m afraid,” Mr.
Lancaster said. “Miss Adair, will you tolerate a
larger boy here?”</p>

<p>He stood smiling, tall and handsome, as different
from ordinary men as Tom had described him; as
far beyond them, Cis thought, seeing him anew
after so long a time.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lancaster!” she cried, as if she had not been
expecting him all the afternoon; wondering in the
back of her brain why he did not come; if it had
not been he, after all, whom Tom had seen in the
station. “Where did you come from? And how
glad I am that you did come!”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t resent what your small friend
here calls my butting in?” Mr. Lancaster suggested,
looking no less happy than the smallest boy there.</p>

<p>“I went to see you, but your friend Mrs.?—Nan?—told
me that you were away, and how to
find you. She seemed to think I might come to the
glen. You look well? Yes, I think you look well,
but I’m not sure of it; you are not just as you were
in Beaconhite, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” said Cis. “But I’m perfectly well.
What of Miss Braithwaite?”</p>

<p>“She is at home again. She was going to write
you, but when I suggested seeing you instead, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
jumped at the idea. She said it was because she detests
letter writing, but I think she wanted closer
communication with you, to get my report of you.
I came on with Paul, Paul Randolph. He is going
to marry Miss Lucas—but she said that she had
told you,” Mr. Lancaster checked himself.</p>

<p>“She did. I hoped—I mean I thought perhaps—Well,
he is lucky, that’s certain. I’d be glad to
have him marry Jeanette if I were his friend,” Cis
stammered, confused.</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster elevated his eyebrows with
a quizzical look. He quite well knew what Cis
would have said if she had gone on with the beginning
of her sentence. But all that he said was:</p>

<p>“I suspect it is one of your secret employments
to provide for your friends’ happiness! And aren’t
you glad that these two are engaged, being a friend
of Miss Lucas? Indeed you well may be; Paul
Randolph is a fine fellow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know he is! I admired him last summer,
but Jeanette is fit for the best, and I’m glad,
surely! She’s perfectly happy. Mr. Lancaster, I’ve
got to see to the boys! Do you mind? I’d far
rather not, but see that pair over there? That
tussle is getting too earnest.” Cis pointed to wrestling
that was rapidly degenerating into a fight.</p>

<p>“I’ve done a meddlesome thing. I want to tell
the lads about it before I tell you, because then you
can’t betray how angry you are with me! But first
may I show that pair—the others will not stand off
long!—a trick or two of Japanese wrestling? Don’t
be afraid; I’ll show them how to use it properly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
They won’t come to harm, and boys have to scrap;
kittens and puppies do, too, you know!” Anselm
Lancaster began to take off his coat as he spoke, not
waiting for Cicely’s assent to his proposal.</p>

<p>She looked at him wondering. Was this the man
whom she had feared, even when she felt most at
home with him and admired him? His nearly forty
years had been thrown off as he was throwing off
his coat; he was like one of the older boys among
her guests, except that his body showed the fine
lines of breeding and training as he faced the lads,
the wind blowing his silken shirt and rumpling his
brown hair.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys!” he said tightening his belt and
settling the loose collar of his shirt. “I know a
thing or two about the way the Japs wrestle. Stand
up to me, you biggest boy over there, and I’ll give
you some points which you’ll find good to know, if
ever you’re in a tight place. I’ll teach the whole
crowd, but you come on first. And in case the lady
in whose charge we’re all here, she-that-must-be-obeyed,
is afraid we’ll be too late getting home, I’ll
tell you that we aren’t going to walk it. I ordered
a truck to come after us at six; it will hold us all,
and get us back to town in fifteen minutes; less!
How does it strike you?”</p>

<p>It struck them into silence for the space of a
breath, and then into a babel of noisy approval.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Lancaster, how kind you are! And
what a lark!” cried Cis, flushed with delight. “Boys,
if you’re yelling, yell right! Three times three for
Mr. Lancaster! Come on; I’ll lead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>Cis bent over and waved her arms in the approved
manner; she had led her school yells in
days past. The nine cheers were given deafeningly,
ending with: “Rah, rah, rah; Lancaster!” which the
boys approved, though they missed its meaning.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Lancaster initiated the boys into the
beginnings of Jiu-jitsu till the big truck came into
the glen, and they all piled in warm, hungry, blissfully
happy.</p>

<p>Mr. Lancaster stood on the running board and
looked the boys over.</p>

<p>“Going to stick to Mass every Sunday, and stand
by like good fellows, every one of you? Come now,
that’s to be a promise! Don’t make it unless you
mean to keep it, but make it and keep it; see the
idea?” he said.</p>

<p>He put out his hand to each boy in turn, and
each boy put his grimy hand into it, and gave the
promise.</p>

<p>The truck made the four miles of homeward road
in less than fifteen minutes. When the boys had all
dispersed, Mr. Lancaster turned to Cis.</p>

<p>“Fine party, Miss Cis,” he said. “Some day, after
they’ve broken that promise, some of those lads
will remember it again and that you were a good
sport, yet loved God.”</p>

<p>“They’ll remember much more that the fine gentleman
who could wrestle and jump was not a deserter,”
retorted Cis warmly. “I can’t thank you
for making my party so splendid, the ride back and
everything, but you don’t want my thanks! Will
you come with me to supper at Nan’s? She’ll be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
delighted if you will come. Or—where shall I hear
about Miss Braithwaite?”</p>

<p>“When I come for you to-night. We are to
spend the evening with Miss Lucas—Paul being understood!”
replied Anselm Lancaster promptly.
“Will you be ready at shortly after eight? We have
important matters to settle; I’m an ambassador.”</p>

<p>“From Miss Braithwaite?” cried Cis. “Oh, Mr.
Lancaster, I want to see her! I miss it all so much!”</p>

<p>“Good to hear that!” He smiled at her. “I won’t
tell you my errand now, but you will walk slowly
and let me present my credentials from the Lady
Miriam to-night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Cis laughed from sheer pleasure.
“I’ve been getting homesick. Nan is as dear as
ever, good, and sweet and dear, but she is so much
married!”</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster laughed. “She met me with
a handsome baby on her hip; I thought she
seemed to like him! But she assured me that you
were almost as fond of him as she is; this was when
I commented on his charms,” he said.</p>

<p>“Like him! Well, yes, Nan does like him!” Cis
laughed also. “And I am nearly as mad over him
as she is, but—” Cis hesitated.</p>

<p>“But the finest baby is not a career for any other
woman save his mother! Then to-night? It is
good to see you again, Miss Cicely,” Mr. Lancaster
said.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Lancaster came to Nan’s door a
little before the appointed hour. “I seem to be
arranging things to suit myself to-day,” he announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
to Cis when she appeared. “I called up
Miss Lucas and said that I had to see you to-night
on behalf of Miss Braithwaite, and that we would
not spend the evening there. Instead, I have found
a car like my own at the garage and have taken it
for the evening. It is a beautiful night, soft little
breeze, pleasant-tempered little moon! I’m going
to drive you about and talk to you. Do you mind?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” Cis hoped that she did not betray
how little she minded. “I must get a heavier wrap,
though. Just a minute, and I’ll be ready.”</p>

<p>“Whither away?” asked Mr. Lancaster, when Cis
was disposed on the seat beside him, a light-weight
rug over her knees.</p>

<p>“Anywhere! I don’t care where; I don’t know
many roads beyond here, though I was born and
brought up here. I don’t think it matters much
which direction you take.”</p>

<p>“We’ll recklessly drive and turn corners, and
after a while have to ask the way back! That
sounds alluring. I always wanted to be lost!” cried
Anselm Lancaster.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you? So did I!” cried Cis. “I used to
try to lose myself when I was a little girl, but I have
an Indian’s sense of direction, and I always went
right!”</p>

<p>“Great thing to have a true sense of direction,
and go right when roads are obscure,” said Anselm.</p>

<p>Cis did not answer; she heard a sub-meaning in
his voice, and wondered if he were thinking of her
bewilderment nearly two years ago.</p>

<p>“Now, about Miss Braithwaite,” said Anselm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
getting away from her silence and her thoughts,
which he divined, and from his own meaning which
he knew that she had caught. “Miss Miriam’s
friend has died, after agony that must have directly
opened heaven to her. Miss Miriam stayed by her
to the end; it was not easy to see. But there’s no
use dwelling on that, beyond resolving to make her
return home as cheerful as possible. You know
what Miss Braithwaite is; she does not repine, and
she has met this torture in the spirit that is hers.
It’s almost harder to see agony that can’t be relieved,
except by anaesthetics daily losing their
efficacy, than it is to bear it. Miss Miriam is sixty-five
years old, dear Miss Cis. That isn’t old; we
know how unfailing her strength is, her strength of
character, of mind, of efficiency, but old age may
be seen coming along at sixty-five, much as if she
were standing on the corner waiting for a trolley
transfer, and the other trolley which she was to take
were bounding down its track toward her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want Miss Braithwaite to be old! I
can’t bear to think of it. She’s one of those persons
who should never be old; so clever, so brilliant,
so highly good!” protested Cis.</p>

<p>“And so vital,” added Anselm. “I can’t imagine
her old. But it would be hard to deny her the reward
of the qualities which make us want to hold
her fast; I imagine that, while she willingly lives
and works, she will be glad to lay down this life
when she is permitted to. No one whose appraisals
are as accurate as hers can value life in itself. However,
that’s beyond our authority. She is lonely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
dear Miss Cis, and she had grown fond of you, dependent
on your youth, your sense of humor, your
mind, which in all its workings responds to hers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, me!” cried Cis. “Why, I’m only twenty-three,
for one thing, and I’m not clever, nor travelled,
nor well-read, so—”</p>

<p>“It isn’t nice to set up tenpins for me to bowl
over,” Anselm teased her. “No one can safely
drive and bowl at the same time. You know quite
well that Miss Braithwaite was happy with you. You
were a bright spot in her charming, but silent
house. The proof of this is that she wants you back.
She was going to write to you, but I’m her ambassador,
as I told you this afternoon. She bids me
beg of you to come back, back to stay, to make your
home with her permanently, unless you find something
else that calls to your true vocation as we both
think you will. She bade me say that if it made
you happier to resume your secretaryship, she was
entirely willing, or for you to take up any other
work, if you like to be occupied, feel independent.
She says that this is not necessary; there would be
no question of obligation to her, ‘she needs you too
badly’—that is what she said—but she will not oppose
you. ‘All that she asks is that she may see
your bright head beside her hearth, know that you
are coming home to her, as her daughter would
come, at the close of every day.’ That is literally her
message, Miss Cicely. I do not think that you can
find it in your heart to say her no.”</p>

<p>Cis did not speak for a few minutes. Anselm
went on silently guiding the smooth motion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
car, guessing that she was as deeply moved as she
actually was. At last Cis spoke, saying:</p>

<p>“You must know how this makes me feel, Mr.
Lancaster. She has been so good to me; she is so
wonderful, and now this! And I am alone. I don’t
suppose anybody, no matter how young and strong
and jolly she may be, can help feeling alone when
she is alone! It’s strange that Miss Braithwaite
wants me now. I have been growing restless, unsatisfied;
I don’t know what is wrong. I don’t enjoy
being here. I love the baby and Nan, but—I’m
ashamed, but Miss Braithwaite, and Father Morley
and you, and even the big things in Mr. Lucas’ office,
have all spoiled me for nice, steady, dull little days!
I’m not better than Nan in brains; not nearly as
good in the other sense, but, I’ve been fed on
stronger food. Even her marriage—Joe is really a
good boy; I do like him, but—Well, it isn’t what
you’d think it would be; what <i>I’d</i> think it would be,
anyway! It’s just like bread and butter three times
a day, every day in the year!”</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster laughed, but he shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you get to craving things too far beyond
common human experience,” he warned her. “The
fact that it is called <i>common</i> experience means that
it is the best lot for the majority. I’ll warrant that
to your Nan her husband is an oracle of wisdom,
and a fount of charm! She’s safe, too; remember
that’s no small asset in marriage. The sort of marriage
that you describe goes peacefully into old age,
undiminished in satisfaction, while hundreds are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
shipwrecked around it which started out to a glorious
fanfare of the trumpets of romance and unfounded
idealization. However, I grant you that
sort of life is not for you. You have outgrown your
childhood comrades, the malnutritive food of little
minds. You’ve been living at high speed for three
years, Cicely Adair; you’ve left behind you the
things of your childhood. Just how does all this
apply to Miss Braithwaite’s appeal to you to come
to her? I’d say that it made it most opportune.”</p>

<p>“It does, oh, it does!” cried Cis. “It takes my
breath away. To go back feeling that I’m wanted,
maybe needed; that I’m to go to make a home there;
that all that beautiful, helpful life for others will
be my life; that I’ll read, think, learn, have Father
Morley to guide me—Mr. Lancaster, I’ve spoken to
you frankly, just as I always did. I’ve always felt
that you would understand. You won’t think I was
criticizing dear little Nannie? I’d give my head to
be as good as she is; dear little soul, always putting
me up, and herself down! But—I want Beaconhite,
and what I had there. Tell me truthfully, is
it right for me to go? Ought I go?”</p>

<p>Anselm Lancaster let the car drop down to a low
speed, and turned to look at Cis, with an expression
on his face which, though she saw it clearly in the
brilliant light of the interior of the car, she could
not construe.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cicely,” he said. “Truthfully I think that
your place is there. I love Miss Miriam dearly; she
is more to me than any of my kindred, more than
any other friend. If it were only that you can be to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
her, now that she needs sustaining, what you can be
would seem to me enough reason for your going,
you who are entirely free to go and do as you will.
She has been a real power for good, an instrument
which has helped to carve out the way for others
to follow her into the Catholic Church, and one
whose charity has bridged many a poor wretch back
into a possible manner of living when hope seemed
over for him. What can you ask better than to
repay some of the debt God’s children owe this
woman? And you say that she has done much for
you. I think that your place is in Beaconhite. If
the decision rests with me, I say: Come! Thrice
over: Come! And may all that lies ahead of you
there, all that may come of it, be blessed and
guided. How can I say aught else, save: Come?”</p>

<p>Cis looked up at him with a tiny smile, her under
lip slightly drawn in, as a child who is half grieved,
half glad smiles. She had many childish ways of
face and hands; Anselm Lancaster and Miss Braithwaite
found them her greatest charm.</p>

<p>“How beautiful to have what you want most to
do also your duty!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“It always is when she who desires is innocent of
wrong-doing, whose heart is God’s first of all,” said
Anselm Lancaster, his words barely audible above
the softly purring engine. “Don’t you know, Cicely
of the red-gold locks, that desire is one of the marks
of a vocation? It was the Puritans who put into
our heads the notion that it was praiseworthy to
hate the thing one chooses. Love Beaconhite and
Miss Braithwaite and choose them! Amen.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

PORT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS settled that Cis was to return to Beaconhite.
Mr. Lancaster had gone back, and immediately
there came a brief, warm, characteristic
letter from Miss Braithwaite to Cis.</p>

<p>“You are to come home on any terms you choose,
my dear,” she wrote, “as long as you come; there
are no terms to my wanting you. If you will establish
yourself in this house for good and all it
will be transformed. My library is large, but not
large enough to fill the vacancy in my life. Summer
is coming, and I shall not be able to keep a fire
on the hearth much of the time; can’t you see how
the library will need your hair in it? I need your
radiance, my child; you are a most vivifying person,
Cicely Adair! Other fires than that on my hearth
are burning low; I grow chilled. Anselm tells me
that you are coming, yet hesitate on the heels of the
resolve lest you may not make good—isn’t that the
way to put it? Let me judge. You know how fully
I speak my mind; I suppose no one ever is doubtful
of my meanings! Then, when I say that coming
to live with me will fulfil several of the corporal
works of mercy—feeding the hungry, comforting
the sorrowful, visiting the sick—of mind, at least—it
is strictly true. I am impatiently waiting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
you; come as soon as you can, please. And be sure
that I am not only lovingly, but gratefully, Your
grumpy old friend, Miriam Braithwaite.”</p>

<p>“You are glad to leave me, Cis—and baby!” Nan
reproached her.</p>

<p>“You are so completely married, Nannie! And
I can’t claim my godson unless I do away with you
and Joe,” Cis replied. “With Jeanette living in
Beaconhite I’ll have one girl friend there. Father
Morley will teach me what I ought to know; he’s
truly a great man. You know what Miss Braithwaite
is; I’ve told you as much as can be told about
her. Life in that house is never far off from the
greatest, the eternal things, but it is also overflowing
with beauty of books, music, art—and Miss
Braithwaite does so love to play like a child, but a
witty, wonderful child! It’s a beautiful life; I can’t
help being glad to live it. But you know I love you,
Nannie!”</p>

<p>Cis took her small friend in her arms to kiss her
hard.</p>

<p>“There’s no chance for Tom, Cis?” hinted Nan.
“I thought, possibly, when you sent Rodney Moore
away—I know you did send him!—that maybe—?
Mother is so anxious for it; she’s going to talk to
you before you go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan, don’t let her!” protested Cis. “That’s
awful; second-hand wooing! If a girl were beginning
to think about a man I’d suppose that it would
turn her off to have his mother come to offer him
to her! Don’t let your mother try that! And help
me to dodge nice young Tommy! Because I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
never in all this world marry the boy, so why bother
about it?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed,” sighed Nan. “I’ll try to head
off my family. I think Tom is convinced that he
stands no chance.”</p>

<p>“He knows I’m truthful and sure of what I
want,” Cis said lightly. “Now I’m going to talk to
Mr. Singer. We’ve everything running in fine
shape down there; it won’t be hard to fit someone
into my shoes.”</p>

<p>“I wish Miss Gallatin would take it,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“I wish she could,” Cis said thoughtfully. “But
it ought to be someone younger, more ornamental.
Girls forget that sort of woman made herself what
she is by being the right sort of girl; they think they
were always elderly and were born with serious,
decorous clothes on, common-sense shoes, and carrying
an umbrella to be ready for storms—a figurative
umbrella against figurative storms, too! Miss
Gallatin is going to stay on in the Lucas household
when Jeanette leaves it. After all, she has a big
field there; all those children and an invalid
mother! I wish I could get a Catholic woman into
the club of Bells—that’s what I call it, but Mr.
Singer won’t let me use that nice name. Lots of the
girls are the kind of Catholics I was, need the
Catholic woman, and she wouldn’t harm the others!
Girls aren’t a bad lot, but it’s marvellous how
crookedly they see and think! I’d like to furnish
them all with folding pocket rules to measure up
by!”</p>

<p>Nan laughed, then sighed. “You’d do for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
pocket rule for all of them, if you’d stay here,” she
said. “A girl like you can do wonders. I’m sorry,
<i>sorry</i> you’re going!”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope I’ll shine as a light to girls in Beaconhite;
there are girls there, silly Nancy!” laughed
Cis. “Nan, I think they named that city expressly
for my coming to it! Hasn’t it been a beacon on
the height to me?”</p>

<p>“It’s your post graduate college; it’s made you
grow up. Oh dear, Cis, I’ve grown up, too, in the
same time, but you have grown away from me!”</p>

<p>“Fast friends forever!” Cis corrected her, and
pretended to mop tears out of Nan’s eyes with her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Yet when it came to the actual parting it was Cis,
not Nan, who cried tempestuously. She realized
that this was a farewell that was final, however true
it might be that they were, as she had said herself,
“fast friends forever.” Complete divergence of
paths and interest ends, not the will to friendship,
but its actuality. At their age Nan, married and
settled, Cis going on to meet life, would pass out of
knowledge of their common beginning. She and
Nan would contrive to meet occasionally, and, thus
meeting, find it difficult to talk together after the
first exchange of news items was over. Cis recognized
this, and felt it sad, but she attributed her
crying to little Matt.</p>

<p>“He will grow every day, and do something new
and darling every day, and I shall not see him, and
he won’t know me when I do see him! If only
babies wouldn’t grow up and begin to go to school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
so soon!” she sobbed, mumbling her godson’s soft
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” cried Nan, shocked by the suggestion
that her son would soon take his place in the ranks
of those in the second age of man’s career.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite’s coupé was waiting at the
Beaconhite station to take Cis home when she arrived.
She jumped into it with a thrill of joy and
received Miss Braithwaite’s quiet, warm welcome
shyly, yet with high delight. It seemed to her that
at last “she belonged,” as she told herself; that this
was a true home-coming.</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite looked tired; Cis saw it after
they had reached the house and were settled down
to tea-serving by Ellen in the splendid library. At
Miss Braithwaite’s age the effects of hard experience
take the appearance of physical ills, and often
their form; it was less that Miss Braithwaite looked
as if she had borne grief since Cis had last seen her,
than that she looked as if she had seriously overtaxed
herself, her nervous strength.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good this is! How happy and how
good!” Cis sighed dropping her hat on the chair
nearest to her, leaning back in the low chair which
she occupied and rumpling her heavy coils of hair
into a looseness adjusted to the upholstery.</p>

<p>“I’ve been bad, Miss Braithwaite, restless, unsatisfied,
not knowing what was wrong, but suspecting
a whole lot of things! And the suspicion that it was
this house and Beaconhite was right! I wanted to
be here.”</p>

<p>“We are going to talk later; now it is tea, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
rest, and this evening talk,” declared Miss Braithwaite.
“Anselm wanted to come here to-night, but
I forbade it; cloister observance for us this first
night! Jeanette Lucas is to marry Paul Randolph,
and be near by. Are you glad?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am, only—Well, of course she wants
to marry Mr. Randolph,” Cis hesitated.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong with him; I’d find him a bit
dull,” declared Miss Braithwaite. “He’s intelligent,
has a nice mind; can’t turn it into currency
to pay his way. I like a talker, as you know. But
he is truly fine, and that he is nobly good he has
given proof. There won’t be lacking those who
will say that he recognized his opportunity; that
marrying Jeanette Lucas was wise, and that his sacrifice
of an income will be made up to him without
much loss of time.”</p>

<p>“How contemptible!” cried Cis. “As though
there were need of looking beyond Jeanette herself
for a reason for wanting to marry her! If Mr.
Randolph had that sort of worldly prudence he
need not have come into the Church at all! Why
are human beings so mean?”</p>

<p>“Because they are human, my dear. People must
belittle fine actions when they are small people; big
deeds are most annoying to small minds; they take
them as personal affronts,” returned Miss Braithwaite
placidly. “It really does not matter about the
chatter of parrakeets. If you are so partizan of
Paul Randolph why did you seem to hesitate just
now in approving the marriage?”</p>

<p>“I always hoped Jeanette would marry Mr. Lancaster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
you know,” said Cis promptly. “But
neither of them ever showed symptoms, so I don’t
suppose it’s Mr. Randolph’s fault.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least!” Miss Braithwaite laughed. “I
sometimes think it may be another girl’s fault,
though. I suspect Anselm of other wishes.”</p>

<p>“How exciting!” cried Cis. “Aren’t you going to
tell me? He seems so splendid, so interested in
affairs, it’s hard to imagine him thinking of marrying.”</p>

<p>Miss Braithwaite laughed again, but she held up
her hands in horror.</p>

<p>“Now heaven forfend!” she cried. “Cis, are you
transforming poor Anselm into the hero of the
early Victorian novel? Solitary, superior, remote,
a demi-god, with the human, half wishy-washy, artificial?
Because it’s distinctly unfair of you, if you
are! He is thoroughly a human being, but he has
made his humanity what God meant a man to be.
To my mind he’s forceful, strong and quick in feeling;
a vital man. He’s precisely the man to think
of marriage, and not to think of it coolly, but to
bring to it a great love, such as would honor any
woman and make her happy.”</p>

<p>Cis stirred uneasily; she could not have said why
she felt uncomfortable, ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything of him that you would
not want me to think, Miss Braithwaite,” she said.
“I don’t know him as you do, of course, but I admire
him almost as much. If only you could have
seen him with those boys! And Tom said in the
station everybody stared at him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>“Boys? Station?” echoed Miss Braithwaite.
“Tell me.”</p>

<p>And Cis told her the story, to which she listened
without comment.</p>

<p>The next day Cis spent happily picking up the
dropped threads of her Beaconhite existence. She
went to Mr. Lucas’ office and received a welcome
beyond her expectation.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear!” Mr. Lucas cried. “Now I shall
have you back as soon as I can open the way for
you! You were a good secretary; I miss you. But
you were also a good confessor of the Faith! Amazing,
but it was you who first brought home to me
unescapably what I’d been suspecting all along;
that there really was something unaccountable on
natural grounds in the Old Church. I’m going to
be a Catholic at Pentecost, my dear Cicely!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; Jeanette told me. I’m so thankful!
And I could cry when you say I was the one
who set you on!” Cis exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Nothing to cry over! We don’t cry Te Deums,
and that’s your theme,” Mr. Lucas smiled at her.
“When will you return to the office? As soon as I
provide the space?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Mr. Lucas. Miss Braithwaite would
rather I’d stay at home all the time, but I’m afraid
that’s a risk for a red-haired girl; they’re not
crickets on hearths! Miss Braithwaite promises me
all that I can do, though. We’ll see. May I have
a few days in which to adjust?” Cis asked. “Now
I’m going on to find Father Morley.”</p>

<p>The Jesuit was at home; he received Cis with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
cordial, yet appraising look that took an inventory
of her days since he had last seen her. He seemed
satisfied with what he saw; his eyes softened and
smiled approvingly. He recognized in Cicely’s face
a new expression of self-reliance, purpose; peace
that was not incompatible with the eager, wistful,
unsatisfied look which her face also wore.</p>

<p>“Ready for the next thing,” he told himself, “and
it’s not far ahead of her.”</p>

<p>But aloud he said: “I am glad, exceedingly glad
that you have come back to us, Cicely. Miss Braithwaite
is thankful; she is deeply attached to you.
You wrote me of that remarkable sequel to your
fidelity to God’s law. Do you care to tell me more
about it?”</p>

<p>“I want to tell you all about it, Father,” Cis answered.
“I might have married Rodney without
wrong-doing, but—Father, I couldn’t! Isn’t that
strange? I didn’t want to. I’m not a fickle person,
but I didn’t want to. He told me that I had been
right as to his still being married. He felt that there
was no divorce when he knelt by his dying wife.
It’s all strange, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t,” said Father Morley. “It is strange,
that you were the one who saved that poor creature
from suicide to die like a Christian, but it is not
strange that her husband recognized the indissoluble
link between them. You will find it always
true that the supernatural law does no violence
to the natural law, but, on the contrary, confirms
it, while elevating it beyond nature. To my
mind that is one of the proofs of the Church.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
Heretics have gone contrary to natural laws in all
sorts of ways. The Church repeatedly proves that
the hand of the Creator is also the hand that
founded her. She has sanctified, ennobled, supernaturalized,
not contradicted man’s natural instincts
and desires. Well, well! You’re not demanding
her proofs! Why do I set poor little you
up as an heretical tenpin to be bowled over? What
is your next step, or do you not know it yet, Cicely
Adair?”</p>

<p>“No, Father,” replied Cis wistfully. “I don’t
know a step; not the next one, nor any beyond that.
Do you think I might be a nun? A Sister of Charity
would be more in my line; active, you know. Is
that what I’m made for?”</p>

<p>Father Morley looked at her gravely, yet with a
quizzical twinkle in his eye, as if he were enjoying
with himself a pleasant secret.</p>

<p>“No, my child, I do not think that is your vocation,”
he said. “I think that you are meant to be
a real helpmeet to a fine man; to do good in the
world, bear witness to the value of Catholic Faith
and standards, and train up your sons and
daughters to carry on that noble inheritance, while
they rise up and call you blessed. Perhaps one day
to see your son raise his hands before the altar,
holding in them the Host, and to kneel, thanking
God with tears, that you upheld those hands for
that miracle.”</p>

<p>“Father!” cried Cicely, and was silent, tears on
her cheeks. “If I might! I’d like that most of all,”
she murmured after an instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>Anselm Lancaster came that evening to see Cis;
he announced that his call was wholly for her. Cis
saw him come into the library with amazement that
his presence so changed it. There was about him
a buoyant happiness; charm went out from him,
and purposeful assertion, which was far from conceit,
sat on his every movement.</p>

<p>“Miss Miriam, Cicely Adair has never seen my
house. I was offended last year that you never
showed it to her, as much as you drove about,
but I hid my wrath. Now I’m out for revenge! I’m
going to show it to her myself, and not invite you!
Cicely, I’ll be here at half past two to-morrow afternoon.
Please be ready to drive with me, out to
my house—it’s a shame you’ve not been shown it!—and
also wherever the fancy takes us to go. This
selfish and unfriendly Miss Miriam shall sit here
and languish, eating her heart out till we return!”</p>

<p>“Is it a matter so serious as a heart-consuming?”
asked Miss Braithwaite.</p>

<p>She caught and returned the flash of a look
which Anselm darted at her.</p>

<p>“I’ll not pretend a virtue I lack; I hope so!” he
said.</p>

<p>Cis was ready when he came for her; he helped
her into his car, and she cried out, almost reproachfully:</p>

<p>“A new car! Why are men always changing
cars? What did you do with that nice one, the
roadster?”</p>

<p>“Turned it in; I don’t need two. I thought when
Paul and Jeanette were married, and you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
here, we’d need the five passenger; we can take
Miss Braithwaite, too. But please don’t speak of
<i>that</i> nice one; as if it weren’t <i>this</i> nice one! Let me
tell you I’m proud of this car!” Anselm said as he
shoved out the brake and started.</p>

<p>“Of course you are! They always are! Boys of
new knives; men of new cars! They are much
alike, aren’t they?” said Cis.</p>

<p>“Knives and cars? Oh, I don’t know; I could
always distinguish the differences,” Anselm remarked.</p>

<p>“Boys and men! I never thought you would be
stupid!” Cis said severely.</p>

<p>“I’ll prove to you I’m not, if you’ll wait a bit!”
Anselm’s remark sounded like a continuation of
the nonsense they were happily talking, but his look
silenced Cis, and set her nervously wondering why
it made her nervous.</p>

<p>The Lancaster house was far finer than Cis had
expected to find it. She had known all along that
Anselm Lancaster had wealth; he used it generously,
and it must have been considerable for him
to accomplish with it all that he did. But ocular
proof is another thing from hearsay. Here was a
house of great dignity, standing in the midst of considerable
land, approached by an avenue of old
trees. Its solid doors, opening, revealed a stately
hall; in the rooms opening from the hall Cis found
old furniture, beautiful and stately. Pictures which
even her untrained eye instantly knew for good
ones, hung on the walls; bronzes, a tall clock, all
sorts of beauty which was evidently the slow accumulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
by many people with taste and means to
gratify it, filled the house.</p>

<p>“How beautiful!” cried Cis. “Why, Mr. Lancaster,
it’s what the novels call a mansion! It’s as fine
as Miss Braithwaite’s house!”</p>

<p>“They are contemporaries. Her great-grandfather
and mine, and each generation since, have
been friends. This house was built when hers was.
My people were not Catholics, till my grandmother
married a Lancaster and brought this house to him;
she became a Catholic after she had married him.
My father married a saintly woman; it is two generations—I
the third—since the Lancaster house
became a Catholic home. Now I try to make it a
home for converts who are put to too hard a test
at first; a temporary home, of course. I’m more
than glad that you like my house, Cicely!”</p>

<p>Anselm spoke in a curious muffled voice, and
Cis smiled up at him, disturbed, at a loss to account
for it, and for the disturbance which she
recognized in him. “How could I not like it?” she
said.</p>

<p>“Will you come to see my dear mother’s sitting
room?” Anselm asked, going toward the stairs. “It
is up one flight. It is like a chapel to me; I’ve
often wanted to make it into one, but there are
necessary sleeping rooms over it; I can’t use it for
a chapel. It is the room in which I was happiest
as a child, though I was always happy. It is the
room where I learned to love books and all beauty,
and where my soul was born through the soul of
that lovely creature who gave me physical life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>Cis followed him, wondering, deeply moved.
This was not the Anselm Lancaster she knew, yet
it was not the contradiction of him; rather it was
his efflorescence. He led her into a small, light
room, facing toward the sunset, which was not yet,
nor for hours, due. Evidently the room had not
been changed since it had been used by the mother
whom he had so dearly loved. Books, a work-basket,
were on the table; a low armchair, considerably
worn, stood beside the table. Anselm gently put
Cis into it, and stood before her.</p>

<p>“My mother’s chair, dear Cicely,” he said. “I
like to see you there. How you would have loved
each other! Cis, dear, lovely, glowing Cicely, don’t
you know what I’ve brought you here to tell you?
Don’t you know? Haven’t you guessed?”</p>

<p>Slowly Cis shook her head, looking at him intently,
as if she were groping her way, her mind rejecting
the one explanation of his words that it
could present to her.</p>

<p>“Why, I love you, Cis! That’s what it is. That’s
easy to guess, easier to understand!” cried Anselm.</p>

<p>“No, no, no! It’s impossible to understand!”
cried Cis.</p>

<p>“You’re going to marry me, dearest; you’re going
to be here in my mother’s place, always. Can’t you
love me? I love you so much!” Anselm pleaded.</p>

<p>“I never once thought of it; never once!” Cis
cried.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to think of it; just do it!” Anselm
said boyishly.</p>

<p>“I think you are the best, the finest—” began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
Cis, but he interrupted her with an impatient exclamation.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Cis, stop! That’s nothing to tell
me, nor to feel! Love me; don’t admire me!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it? I think I couldn’t love anyone I didn’t
admire,” said Cis, trying to find her puzzled way.
“I loved someone; you know that. I was crazy to
see him; it made my breath short when he came;
I—One doesn’t love again, does she? But I know
now that I couldn’t love him last winter because I
didn’t admire him.”</p>

<p>“Cis, dear,” began Anselm, sitting on the edge
of the table as if he meant to argue it out, “I think
we don’t love again in that same first way; it’s the
dream of youth. I had it, too, but I was only a lad
of seventeen when I fell madly in love. You were
older than I when it happened to you but you were
not much older, and you were no more experienced,
and experience is what counts in these things.
There is a glamor over everything that is part of
that time of life, and we have our first love hard.
But, dear, it’s not in the same class with our later,
mature love. Do you imagine I felt for that little
fluffy girl of twenty whom I loved when I was seventeen,
anything like what I feel for you? Nor was
that first love of yours, which you so bravely conquered
for God’s sake, the love you’ll feel for your
husband, who will be one with you in all things of
soul and body. Cis, honestly—though it may sound
conceited—I am sure you love me. Will you be
sure of it? Father Morley, Miss Braithwaite, Jeanette,
hope for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>“Oh! Do they all know?” gasped Cis.</p>

<p>“That I love you? Surely. Blind little Cis not
to have known it yourself! But now that you do
know it—”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t so much as think of marrying you!”
Cis hastily interrupted him. “Why, I’d be—what
would I be? One of the people brought into a
country to serve it, then deserting its flag—a
traitor! That’s it! Miss Braithwaite imported me
to live with her, be almost a daughter to her. Much
good I’d do her if I—”</p>

<p>“Now, Cicely, can’t you trust Miss Miriam to
me?” Anselm interrupted in his turn. “Do you
suppose we haven’t discussed my hopes? Haven’t
I just told you that she wanted them fulfilled?
Good mothers do not want to mortgage their
daughters’ lives; they want them to find their own
places and happily fill them. Miss Braithwaite
shall not lose you if I win you, dear one! She is
most anxious for this marriage, Cis. ‘Cis must come
to me, Anselm; then you shall woo her at your best.
She shall be in her home, the home that holds you
part of it, and I hope that will incline her to
harken to you. But if not, then at least she is still
in her own home; the dear child will be made secure
however she decides.’ That is what she said
to me, Cicely beloved, before I went away to try to
bring you back. Marry me, then there will be another
besides ourselves happy; Miss Miriam the
third rejoicing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can possibly mean that you
want to marry me!” said Cis slowly abandoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
Miss Braithwaite’s cause. “Don’t you think you
mean someone else?”</p>

<p>“I distinctly think that I mean no one else!”
cried Anselm. “Do I strike you as positively feeble-minded?
There’s no difficulty in telling you from
all others. I can tell you apart literally, quite apart
from all others created! And I’m not grave and
settled down; I’m only thirty-eight, darling! Are
you thinking of me as solemn, serious, almost
elderly? No, no; I’m not! I’m your lover, Cis, and
he loves you more than he can tell you. Will you
come here, Cis, desire of my heart? Will you help
me in the beautiful schemes we’ve discussed? Take
my mother’s place, but fill only your own place, my
wife’s place, my helpmeet’s place—and more; a
thousand times more!”</p>

<p>“You are meant to be a real helpmeet to a fine
man.” Cis heard Father Morley’s voice again saying
these words to her. He had known when he
said it that Anselm meant to ask her to marry him;
he wanted her to marry Anselm, though Anselm
was a great man, while she was only red-haired
Cicely Adair!</p>

<p>It came upon her with an irresistible rush of conviction
that she did love Anselm, that she had
been loving him and had not known it. For how
could she ever have thought of his loving her?
Yet this was why all other things, Nan, her old
home, Rodney Moore seemed insufficient to her;
this was why she had been restless, longing, unsatisfied.
What a life it was that opened out before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
her in this house, the wife of this man, his helpmeet,
his beloved!</p>

<p>Distrust of herself, the magnitude of the joy
stretching out before her drove her into the true
woman’s dalliance with yielding to this unforeseen
bliss.</p>

<p>She must hold off for a little while the glorious
submergence of herself out of which she knew
would arise the truer, greater self which would
forevermore be Cicely.</p>

<p>“Take me home,” Cis said rising. “I cannot answer
yet.”</p>

<p>Obediently Anselm followed her toward the
door, but he looked bitterly disappointed. Cis
halted, wavering, on the threshold, as her heart
smote her for this look. This was Anselm’s mother’s
room, the sanctuary of his childhood, the shrine of
a tender love. It would be sweet to make him happy
here; he had brought her hither for this.</p>

<p>She was a generous Cicely, albeit a frightened
one. She turned fully and faced Anselm.</p>

<p>“I think I do. Love you, I mean. I’ll come,”
she said.</p>

<p>He caught her, reverently, gratefully, yet most
lovingly in his arms and kissed her flaming hair,
her white brow, her closed eyes, and at last, with
the bridegroom’s kiss, he kissed her sweet lips.</p>

<p>The great cable which had held her fast, had also
drawn Cis safe into port.</p>
